In Japan for the G20 Summit. I will always put the interest of AMERICA first! We can't have any more WEAK Democrats apologizing for the GREATEST country on Earth!
Seems totally ridiculous that our government, and indeed Country, cannot ask a basic question of Citizenship in a very expensive, detailed and important Census, in this case for 2020. I have asked the lawyers if they can delay the Census, no matter how long, until the United States Supreme Court is given additional information from which it can make a final and decisive decision on this very critical matter. Can anyone really believe that as a great Country, we are not able the ask whether or not someone is a Citizen. Only in America!
Our economy is STRONG and GROWING! The U.S. economy grew at a 3.1% rate in first quarter!
If the Democrat Debate last night taught America anything, it‚Äôs that we CAN‚ÄôT go back to a Democrat in the White House!
Thank you MSNBC, real professionals!
I look forward to speaking with Prime Minister Modi about the fact that India, for years having put very high Tariffs against the United States, just recently increased the Tariffs even further. This is unacceptable and the Tariffs must be withdrawn!
BORING!
Byron York: ‚ÄúWhat now, for those who denied a 'crisis' at the border?‚Äù
Ever since the passage of the Super Predator Crime Bill, pushed hard by Joe Biden, together with Bill and Crooked Hillary Clinton, which inflicted great pain on many, but especially the African American Community, Democrats have tried and failed to pass Criminal Justice Reform. They came to me asking for help, and I got Criminal Justice Reform passed, with help from both Republicans and Democrats. Many said that nobody but President Trump could have done this. All previous administrations failed. Please ask why THEY failed to the candidates!
The Republican Senate just passed bipartisan humanitarian assistance for our Southern Border, 84-8! In addition to aid, Congress must close the catastrophic loopholes that are driving the Crisis. We must end incentives for Smuggling Children, Trafficking Women, and Selling Drugs.
STOP THE BIAS!
I want far BETTER deals for the United States. We can't have WEAK Democrats negotiating deals for the American people!
Latinos currently see their lowest unemployment rate in HISTORY. I will keep delivering for the Latino community and the rest of America!

55,000 new JOBS were added in Nevada since last May. That‚Äôs the FASTEST rate in the nation for the 8th consecutive month! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
Democrats want Open Borders, which equals violent crime, drugs and human trafficking. They also want very high taxes, like 90%. Republicans want what‚Äôs good for America - the exact opposite!

Presidential Harassment!
Today, it was my great honor to present the Medal of Honor to Army Staff Sgt. David Bellavia (HERO) for his courageous actions as a squad leader in Fallujah.
Today, I signed an Executive Order Establishing a White House Council on Eliminating Regulatory Barriers to Affordable Housing!
While the Democrats are in Miami talking about higher taxes, more regulation and radical left-wing policies, WE came to talk about our tremendous RESULTS!
The U.S. is committed to increasing Apprenticeship opportunities in America! JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
My Executive Order on healthcare price transparency is perhaps one of the most important reforms in the history of American healthcare in a very long time. We are giving power BACK to the patients!
Latinos are doing GREAT due to the policies of my administraion. AMERICA is BACK!
Today, my campaign announced our 'Latinos for Trump' coalition. Under my administration, Latinos see the lowest unemployment rate EVER, 1.9M jobs created for Latinos, and the lowest poverty level EVER for Latinos. FOUR MORE YEARS!
I requested $4.5 BILLION in humanitarian aid 2 MONTHS AGO! What did Democrats in Congress do? NOTHING. Now they're divided over stopping a humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border!
Democrats continue to take the Latino vote for granted. Nobody has delivered more for Latinos than my administration. I will continue to deliver when I get FOUR MORE YEARS!
"President Donald J. Trump's schedule for Tuesday, June 25th:

Together, we stared down a corrupt and broken political establishment, and we restored government of, by, and for the people. Our country is now thriving, prospering, and booming and, frankly, it‚Äôs SOARING to incredible new heights. Our economy is the envy of the world, perhaps the GREATEST economy we‚Äôve had in the history of our country.
Today's landmark healthcare action continues my mission to put American patients first. We believe the American people have the right to know the price of services before they go to visit the doctor!
Smugglers are now SCARED to cross the Guatemala-Mexico border because Mexico has upped it's security after we said we would put tariffs on them. If only the Democrats did as much as Mexico is doing to protect America!
I have just signed hard-hitting sanctions on Iran following a series of aggressive behavior by the Iranian regime in recent weeks including the shooting down of a U.S. Drone.
I am pleased to announce the launch of http://tmagac.winred.com. This new platform will allow my campaign and other Republicans to compete with the Democrats money machine. This has been a priority of mine and I‚Äôm pleased to share that it is up and running!

We can't allow the Radical Democrats to destroy our progress! KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
This week I announced my Second Term Presidential Run. We need FOUR MORE YEARS of putting the American people first and a strong economy!
The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. But they must STOP THE BIAS against conservatives!
Ivanka Trump joined Secretary Mike Pompeo to unveil the 2019 Trafficking in Persons (TIP) Report and HONOR the ‚Äòfreedom keepers‚Äô devoting their lives to fight human trafficking.
I want to give the Democrats every last chance to quickly negotiate simple changes to Asylum and Loopholes. This will fix the Southern Border, together with the help that Mexico is now giving us. Probably won‚Äôt happen, but worth a try. Two weeks and big Deportation begins!
We MUST WIN to KEEP AMERICA GREAT! üá∫üá∏
BUILDING THE WALL!
At the request of Democrats, I have delayed the Illegal Immigration Removal Process (Deportation) for two weeks to see if the Democrats and Republicans can get together and work out a solution to the Asylum and Loophole problems at the Southern Border. If not, Deportations start!
Iran cannot have Nuclear Weapons! Under the terrible Obama plan, they would have been on their way to Nuclear in a short number of years, and existing verification is not acceptable. We are putting major additional Sanctions on Iran on Monday. I look forward to the day that Sanctions come off Iran, and they become a productive and prosperous nation again - The sooner the better!
I am at Camp David working on many things, including Iran! We have a great Economy, Tariffs have been very helpful both with respect to the huge Dollars coming IN, & on helping to make good Trade Deals. The Dow heading to BEST June in 80 years! Stock Market BEST June in 50 years!
When people come into our Country illegally, they will be DEPORTED!
Democrats are doing NOTHING to solve the border crisis. Mexico is doing much more!
Because of the strong economy we created, American wages will be HIGHER than the national $15 minimum wage that Democrats are calling for!
"The Sunshine State has played host to many a Trump rally over the last four years, but nothing‚Äôs come close to what we just saw in Orlando."
Thanks to all of the amazing job creation under my administration, we need LEGAL immigrants to come to America for work! We also have the LOWEST Hispanic unemployment rate in the history of our country!
We need FOUR MORE YEARS of Promises Kept for America! We can't go back!
My popularity is RISING with Latinos! They see our BOOMING Economy and they see our fight for a SECURE border & laws that support SMART immigration. We're also standing for FREEDOM, not socialism!
President Obama made a desperate and terrible deal with Iran - Gave them 150 Billion Dollars plus I.8 Billion Dollars in CASH! Iran was in big trouble and he bailed them out. Gave them a free path to Nuclear Weapons, and SOON. Instead of saying thank you, Iran yelled Death to America. I terminated deal, which was not even ratified by Congress, and imposed strong sanctions. They are a much weakened nation today than at the beginning of my Presidency, when they were causing major problems throughout the Middle East. Now they are Bust! On Monday they shot down an unmanned drone flying in International Waters. We were cocked & loaded to retaliate last night on 3 different sights when I asked, how many will die. 150 people, sir, was the answer from a General. 10 minutes before the strike I stopped it, not proportionate to shooting down an unmanned drone. I am in no hurry, our Military is rebuilt, new,  and ready to go, by far the best in the world. Sanctions are biting & more added last night. Iran can NEVER have Nuclear Weapons, not against the USA, and not against the WORLD!

Just returning from Orlando and Doral (Miami), Florida, and heading to the Oval Office, where I will present the great Economist, Dr. Arthur Laffer, with the Presidential Medal of Freedom.
The American people must send ANOTHER earthquake to the ballot box in 2020. We need to make it clear to the SWAMP that our movement is the American movement!
Today, we join the nation in celebrating Juneteenth, commemorating the day in 1865 that all African Americans were ‚Äòfree at last‚Äô through the official abolition of slavery.
This GREAT movement is because of YOU, the American people! I will NEVER stop fighting for you!
The American Dream is BACK. It's BIGGER, BETTER, and STRONGER than ever before! Our future is BRIGHT - that's why we can't elect Democrats!
We are going to take on the Radical Democrats BIG TIME in 2020!
The Dems are very unhappy with the Mueller Report, so after almost 3 years, they want a Redo, or Do Over. This is extreme Presidential Harassment. They gave Crooked Hillary‚Äôs people complete Immunity, yet now they bring back Hope Hicks. Why aren‚Äôt the Dems looking at the 33,000 Emails that Hillary and her lawyer deleted and acid washed AFTER GETTING A SUBPOENA FROM CONGRESS? That is real Obstruction that the Dems want no part of because their hearings are RIGGED and a disgrace to our Country!
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Don‚Äôt ever forget - this election is about YOU. It is about YOUR family, YOUR future, & the fate of YOUR COUNTRY. We begin our campaign with the best record, the best results, the best agenda, & the only positive VISION for our Country‚Äôs future!
In the ultimate act of moral cowardice, not one Democrat Candidate for president - not a single one - has stood up to defend the incredible men and women of ICE and Border Patrol. They don‚Äôt have the character, the virtue, or the spine!
On no issue are Democrats more extreme ‚Äì and more depraved ‚Äì than when it comes to Border Security. The Democrat Agenda of open borders is morally reprehensible. It is the great betrayal of the American Middle Class and our Country as a whole!
Together, we are breaking the most sacred rule in Washington Politics: we are KEEPING our promises to the American People. Because my only special interest is YOU!

Big Rally tomorrow night in Orlando, Florida, looks to be setting records. We are building large movie screens outside to take care of everybody. Over 100,000 requests. Our Country is doing great, far beyond what the haters & losers thought possible - and it will only get better!
Looking forward to being in Orlando, Florida to announce my Second Term Presidential Run and discuss how GREAT our country is doing!
Nervous Nancy Pelosi & the Democrat House are getting nothing done. Perhaps they could lead the way with the USMCA, the spectacular & very popular new Trade Deal that replaces NAFTA, the worst Trade Deal in the history of the U.S.A. Great for our Farmers, Manufacturers & Unions? Do your JOB!
Four years ago today, I started my presidential campaign for the Forgotten Men and Women of America. Look how far we have come! Now we must KEEP AMERICA GREAT!
Happy Father's Day to all!
We are in a STRONG position for 2020. Promises Made, Promises Kept!
The Corrupt News Media is totally out of control - they have given up and don‚Äôt even care anymore. Mainstream Media has ZERO CREDIBILITY - TOTAL LOSERS!
The Trump Economy is setting records, and has a long way up to go....However, if anyone but me takes over in 2020 (I know the competition very well), there will be a Market Crash the likes of which has not been seen before! KEEP AMERICA GREAT
Despite the Greatest Presidential Harassment of all time by people that are very dishonest and want to destroy our Country, we are doing great in the Polls, even better than in 2016, and will be packed at the Tuesday Announcement Rally in Orlando, Florida. KEEP AMERICA GREAT!

After 3 1/2 years, our wonderful Sarah Huckabee Sanders will be leaving the White House at the end of the month and going home to the Great State of Arkansas. She is a very special person with extraordinary talents, who has done an incredible job! I hope she decides to run for Governor of Arkansas - she would be fantastic. Sarah, thank you for a job well done!
I meet and talk to ‚Äúforeign governments‚Äù every day. I just met with the Queen of England (U.K.), the Prince of Wales, the P.M. of the United Kingdom, the P.M. of Ireland, the President of France and the President of Poland. We talked about ‚ÄúEverything!‚Äù Should I immediately call the FBI about these calls and meetings? How ridiculous! I would never be trusted again. With that being said, my full answer is rarely played by the Fake News Media. They purposely leave out the part that matters.
Voters in KEY battleground states widely support what I've been saying on immigration - CONGRESS NEEDS TO ACT!
Crazy Bernie and the rest of the Radical Democrats want to get rid of our successful TAX CUTS for the middle class!

"President Donald J. Trump's schedule for Thursday, June 13th:

We can not allow Democrats to REPEAL the Trump Tax Cuts that have benefited 82% of Middle Class Americans. Democrats want to RAISE taxes on Americans to pay for their RIDICULOUS proposals!
The RADICAL Green New Deal would cost America AT LEAST 1 MILLION JOBS. It would be a total DISASTER for our country and the economy that we have worked so hard to get back (and succeed in doing)!
The Radical Democrats want to impose Medicare-For-All. That means TOTALLY getting rid of American's private health insurance in addition to MANY more consequences!
As our nations mark 100 years of diplomatic relations, the U.S.‚ÄìPoland alliance is stronger than ever before! üá∫üá∏ üáµüá±
Joe Biden said China was NOT a competitor of ours. A total Dummy!
The Fake News has never been more dishonest than it is today. Thank goodness we can fight back on Social Media. Their new weapon of choice is Fake Polling, sometimes referred to as Suppression Polls (they suppress the numbers). Had it in 2016, but this is worse. The Fake (Corrupt) News Media said they had a leak into polling done by my campaign which, by the way and despite the phony and never ending Witch Hunt, are the best numbers WE have ever had. They reported Fake numbers that they made up & don‚Äôt even exist. WE WILL WIN AGAIN!

It was my HONOR to represent America abroad this week and to commemorate D-Day with some of the bravest people who ever lived, our Veterans!
When will the Failing New York Times admit that their front page story on the  the new Mexico deal at the Border is a FRAUD and nothing more than a badly reported ‚Äúhit job‚Äù on me, something that has been going on since the first day I announced for the presidency! Sick Journalism
We have fully signed and documented another very important part of the Immigration and Security deal with Mexico, one that the U.S. has been asking about getting for many years.

"After years in which the Obama administration delayed and thwarted any major action against the Big Tech companies, the decision has apparently even shamed some House Democrats into playing along."
‚ÄúThe Democrats and the biased media will nonetheless do their best to downplay the historic achievements of the Trump economy, but nothing they say can change the fact that Americans are far better off today than they have been for a long time and certainly better off than they were three years ago.‚Äù
If President Obama made the deals that I have made, both at the Border and for the Economy, the Corrupt Media would be hailing them as Incredible, & a National Holiday would be immediately declared. With me, despite our record setting Economy and all that I have done, no credit!

I am pleased to inform you that The United States of America has reached a signed agreement with Mexico. The Tariffs scheduled to be implemented by the U.S. on Monday, against Mexico, are hereby indefinitely suspended. Mexico, in turn, has agreed to take strong measures to stem the tide of Migration through Mexico, and to our Southern Border. This is being done to greatly reduce, or eliminate, Illegal Immigration coming from Mexico and into the United States. Details of the agreement will be released shortly by the State Department.

ISIS plotted to send terrorists through the US-Mexico border. The Democrats continue to FALSELY claim there is no CRISIS at the border. Democrats must stop putting this country at risk for pure political gain!
Strong Jobs Report for the month of May. Our economy is BOOMING and we are putting AMERICA FIRST!
If we are able to make the deal with Mexico, & there is a good chance that we will, they will begin purchasing Farm & Agricultural products at very high levels, starting immediately. If we are unable to make the deal, Mexico will begin paying Tariffs at the 5% level on Monday!
Nervous Nancy Pelosi is a disgrace to herself and her family for having made such a disgusting statement, especially since I was with foreign leaders overseas. There is no evidence for such a thing to have been said. Nervous Nancy & Dems are getting Zero work done in Congress and have no intention of doing anything other than going on a fishing expedition to see if they can find anything on me - both illegal & unprecedented in U.S. history. There was no Collusion - Investigate the Investigators! Go to work on Drug Price Reductions & Infrastructure!
The U.S. is standing firm. Mexico must act to stop the flow of migrants through their country!

We have an undeniable crisis at the Southern Border that Mexico needs to help solve. Democrats need to recognize this is REAL!
Mexico immediately sent representatives to Washington once the potential tariffs were announced. They know I am not playing games. The crisis at the border must be fixed!
DACA recipient says he is NOT for the "DREAM & PROMISE ACT" passed by Dems in the House because it is "time to work together." We must work to fix the border crisis!
So sorry to hear about the terrible accident involving our GREAT West Point Cadets. We mourn the loss of life and pray for the injured. God Bless them ALL!
Democrats refuse to help with the humanitarian crisis at the Southern Border. My Administration is seeking $4.5B to address the humanitarian emergency. Dems won't budge!
On the 75th Anniversary of D-Day, we remember and honor some of the bravest people that ever lived. We proudly commemorate these heroes who gave their all to defend freedom and to protect civilization as we know it. We will NEVER forget their sacrifice!
Immigration discussions at the White House with representatives of Mexico have ended for the day. Progress is being made, but not nearly enough! Border arrests for May are at 133,000 because of Mexico & the Democrats in Congress refusing to budge on immigration reform. Further talks with Mexico will resume tomorrow with the understanding that, if no agreement is reached, Tariffs at the 5% level will begin on Monday, with monthly increases as per schedule. The higher the Tariffs go, the higher the number of companies that will move back to the USA!
The crisis at our Southern Border is at a BREAKING POINT. Approximately 1 MILLION aliens are projected to arrive at the Southern Border this year alone. More than 100,000 aliens have arrived each of the past two months!

If the totally Corrupt Media was less corrupt, I would be up by 15 points in the polls based on our tremendous success with the economy, maybe Best Ever! If the Corrupt Media was actually fair, I would be up by 25 points. Nevertheless, despite the Fake News, we‚Äôre doing great!
Can you imagine Cryin‚Äô Chuck Schumer saying out loud, for all to hear, that I am bluffing with respect to putting Tariffs on Mexico. What a Creep. He would rather have our Country fail with drugs & Immigration than give Republicans a win. But he gave Mexico bad advice, no bluff!
Today, let us renew our pledge engraved at the American Cemetery in Normandy, and inscribed by President Dwight Eisenhower in St. Paul's Cathedral right here in London, that 'the cause for which they died shall live.
Tomorrow, Prime Minister May and I will attend a commemoration ceremony in Portsmouth, UK, to honor the more than one and a half million American service members who were stationed in England during WW2.
Democrats in Congress continue to drag their feet on approving the USMCA which has enough votes in the House to PASS! Almost 400 businesses support the deal. Take it to the floor, Nancy. Stop STONEWALLING!
Just had a big victory in Federal Court over the Democrats in the House on the desperately needed Border Wall. A big step in the right direction. Wall is under construction!
As the U.K. makes preparations for Brexit, the United States is committed to a phenomenal trade deal between our two nations!

China is subsidizing its product in order that it can continue to be sold in the USA. Many firms are leaving China for other countries, including the United States, in order to avoid paying the Tariffs. No visible increase in costs or inflation, but U.S. is taking Billions!

Mexico is sending a big delegation to talk about the Border. Problem is, they‚Äôve been ‚Äútalking‚Äù for 25 years. We want action, not talk. They could solve the Border Crisis in one day if they so desired. Otherwise, our companies and jobs are coming back to the USA!

The economy is BOOMING because we are putting America First!
Mexico has taken advantage of the United States for decades. Because of the Dems, our Immigration Laws are BAD. It is also time for Mexico to finally do what must be done!

90% of the Drugs coming into the United States come through Mexico & our Southern Border. 80,000 people died last year, 1,000,000 people ruined. This has gone on for many years & nothing has been done about it. We have a 100 Billion Dollar Trade Deficit with Mexico. It‚Äôs time!
Hard to believe that with the Crisis on the Border, the Dems won‚Äôt do the quick and easy fix. Would solve the problem but they want Open Borders, which equals crime!
On June 10th, the United States will impose a 5% Tariff on all goods coming into our Country from Mexico, until such time as illegal migrants coming through Mexico, and into our Country, STOP. The Tariff will gradually increase until the Illegal Immigration problem is remedied, at which time the Tariffs will be removed. Details from the White House to follow.
This is a VERY SAD period in this country's history. One of my biggest achievements in the end will be exposing the corruption in Washington!
Robert Mueller came to the Oval Office (along with other potential candidates) seeking to be named the Director of the FBI. He had already been in that position for 12 years, I told him NO. The next day he was named Special Counsel - A total Conflict of Interest. NICE!

Very sad to hear the news on the passing of my friend, Senator Thad Cochran. He was a real Senator with incredible values - even flew back to Senate from Mississippi for important Healthcare Vote when he was desperately ill. Thad never let our Country (or me) down!
The Do Nothing Democrats!
The Greatest Presidential Harassment in history. After spending $40,000,000 over two dark years, with unlimited access, people, resources and cooperation, highly conflicted Robert Mueller would have brought charges, if he had ANYTHING, but there were no charges to bring!
How do you impeach a Republican President for a crime that was committed by the Democrats? WITCH-HUNT!

Democrats in Congress need to read the USMCA and get it PASSED! This is a great deal for the American people!
Nothing changes from the Mueller Report. There was insufficient evidence and therefore, in our Country, a person is innocent. The case is closed! Thank you.
Sleepy Joe Biden has been WRONG on Foreign Policy for 40 Years! He was wrong on the Iraq War, the Syria ‚ÄúRed Line," the ‚ÄúRussia Reset,‚Äù the bin Laden raid, and on the Iran nuclear deal! Even Obama and Biden's former Secretary of Defense agrees!

I will be making two stops this morning in Japan to visit with our Great Military, then a quick stop in Alaska and back to D.C. Meetings with Prime Minister Abe went very well, and getting to spend time with the new Emperor and Empress of Japan was a great honor!
Anyone associated with the 1994 Crime Bill will not have a chance of being elected. In particular, African Americans will not be able to vote for you. I, on the other hand, was responsible for Criminal Justice Reform, which had tremendous support, and helped fix the bad 1994 Bill!
On this Memorial Day, we remember and honor the HEROES who have sacrificed their lives so we can live freely! We will NEVER forget you.
On Memorial Day we pray, remember, and honor those who have died while serving in the U.S. Armed Forces. Our nation is forever thankful for those who paid the ultimate sacrifice to defend our nation and freedom. I wish everyone a peaceful Memorial Day!

The Radical Democrats plan a government TAKEOVER of healthcare. That means ELIMINATING private plans. I will make healthcare more affordable AND accessible using free market principles. We will protect pre-existing conditions!
I don‚Äôt know why the Radical Left Democrats want Bob Mueller to testify when he just issued a 40 Million Dollar Report that states, loud & clear & for all to hear, No Collusion and No Obstruction (how do you Obstruct a NO crime?) Dems are just looking for trouble and a Do-Over!
Nancy is a MESS! She doesn‚Äôt understand the USMCA. She needs another TWO WEEKS to read it! Learn the bill and ACT!

Mueller and the Angry Democrats spent MILLIONS of taxpayer money on a HOAX! They found NO COLLUSION & NO OBSTRUCTION as I said all along. There was NO NOTHING!
Democrats in Congress continue to ABUSE their power in an attempt to destroy my presidency. Hard to do when there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION! Presidential Harassment!
No collusion. No obstruction.
Much of the Wall being built at the Southern Border is a complete demolition and rebuilding of old and worthless barriers with a brand new Wall and footings. Problem is, the Haters say that is not a new Wall, but rather a renovation. Wrong, and we must build where most needed. Also, tremendous work is being done on pure renovation - fixing existing Walls that are in bad condition and ineffective, and bringing them to a very high standard!

The Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) would have been a disaster for Pennsylvania and other parts of the Rust Belt. That's why I PROUDLY withdrew the U.S. from this horrible deal in my FIRST WEEK!

Our Economy and Jobs Market is BOOMING, the best in the World and in our Country‚Äôs history - and we have just started!
Pennsylvania's unemployment rate is at an ALL-TIME HISTORIC LOW! Pretty tough to be beat!
I am very disappointed that Mexico is doing virtually nothing to stop illegal immigrants from coming to our Southern Border where everyone knows that because of the Democrats, our Immigration Laws are totally flawed & broken. Mexico‚Äôs attitude is that people from other countries, including Mexico, should have the right to flow into the U.S. & that U.S. taxpayers should be responsible for the tremendous costs associated w/ this illegal migration. Mexico is wrong and I will soon be giving a response!

I was NOT going to fire Bob Mueller, and did not fire Bob Mueller. In fact, he was allowed to finish his Report with unprecedented help from the Trump Administration. Actually, lawyer Don McGahn had a much better chance of being fired than Mueller. Never a big fan!
I think that China felt they were being beaten so badly in the recent negotiation that they may as well wait around for the next election, 2020, to see if they could get lucky & have a Democrat win - in which case they would continue to rip-off the USA for $500 Billion a year. The only problem is that they know I am going to win (best economy & employment numbers in U.S. history, & much more), and the deal will become far worse for them if it has to be negotiated in my second term. Would be wise for them to act now, but love collecting BIG TARIFFS!

This was a week of Making America Safe and Making America Prosperous!
Today, I announced a National Emergency to help secure and control our southern border. This is a National Security crisis and I am solving it quickly!
Twitter, Facebook and Google are not for "free expression." They are totally biased in favor of Democrats!
"President Donald J. Trump's schedule for Friday, February 15th:

These are ordinary Americans, not Washington politicians, who have seen first-hand how a border wall brought safety and security back to their community.
My representatives have just left North Korea after a very productive meeting and an agreed upon time and date for the second Summit with Kim Jong Un. It will take place in Hanoi, Vietnam, on February 27 & 28. I look forward to seeing Chairman Kim & advancing the cause of peace!

There is no limit to what we can achieve when we put our citizens first, reject politics, and choose compromise!

"By the end of next year, NATO allies will add $100 billion extra toward defense...President Donald Trump is having an impact.‚Äù
This is an invasion of our country. We need a WALL!
Nancy Pelosi doesn‚Äôt want to give proper border security for political reasons. She's doing a terrible disservice to the people of our country!
Our economy is exceeding expectations ‚Äì unprecedented job growth, historically low unemployment, and rising wages. MAGA!
Tomorrow night I will address the nation, sharing my vision for a safer, stronger, and more prosperous America!
Tune in to hear how I am fighting for you!
Only through UNITY can we deliver for the people we were elected to serve!
As one team, one people, and one American family, we can accomplish ANYTHING.
JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!
America First doesn‚Äôt mean America alone. Venezuela, we are with you!
The media continue to prove themselves as the true ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE!
Now more than ever, we need a WALL!
"The media tries to make it look like I am against ""intelligence."" I am not!
""Questioning of the CIA and other intelligence agency assessments is precisely what a prudent leader should do before making critical decisions affecting our national security."""

We are not even into February and the cost of illegal immigration so far this year is $18,959,495,168. There are at least 25,772,342 illegal aliens, not the 11,000,000 that have been reported for years, in our country. So ridiculous!
After all that I have done, does anybody really think I won‚Äôt build the WALL? Done more in first two years than any President! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
New poll! Voters in vulnerable Democrat districts ‚Äúsupport the president‚Äôs position on border security," NOT Speaker Pelosi's.

Many disagree, but I really feel that working with Democrats and Republicans, we can make a truly GREAT and SECURE deal happen for everyone.
"Let me be very clear: We have no choice but to build a powerful wall or steel barrier.
If we don‚Äôt get a fair deal from Congress, the government will either shut down on February 15th, again, or I will use the powers afforded to me under the laws and the Constitution of the United States to address this emergency."
In a short while, I will sign a bill to open our Government for three weeks until February 15th. I will make sure that all employees receive their back pay very quickly.
Democrats ‚Äì stop playing games and give Americans the GREAT border security they deserve!
"President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs schedule for Friday, January 25th:

If we ever let the Radical Left control our borders, we would have crime, drugs, and human trafficking like we have never seen before in the HISTORY of our country!
My poll numbers have gone way up with Hispanics. That is because they know the border issue better than anyone, and they want security!
"‚ÄúThe fact that President Trump has been able to achieve so much of his agenda despite the coordinated campaign to defy him is astounding.‚Äù 
So true. We've accomplished the unthinkable and we're still WINNING despite constant attacks!"
Today we celebrate Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. for standing up for the self-evident truth Americans hold so dear, that no matter what the color of our skin or the place of our birth, we are all created equal by God. https://bit.ly/2RUJNPO

Our goal is simple: to ensure that we can DETECT and DESTROY any missile launched against the United States‚Äîanywhere, anytime, anyplace.
If we don‚Äôt defend our borders, then we cease to be a nation.
We must have border security ‚Äì not for political purposes, but for our COUNTRY and for the SAFETY of our communities.
This is the reason why Democrats don‚Äôt want the wall: they all know it WORKS!

¬∑ Lunch with Secretary of State
¬∑ Signing ceremony for S. 24, ‚ÄúGovernment Employee Fair Treatment Act of 2019‚Äù"
Working hard!
The crisis of illegal immigration impacts ALL Americans.
Democrats used to support funding for border security, but now they've changed their minds. POLITICS!
Volkswagen will be investing $800 million to build electric cars in the U.S. Congratulations to Chattanooga, Tennessee. A BIG WIN!
There is a massive humanitarian crisis at our southern border ‚Äì even 71% of Democrats agree. You need GREAT border security!
Ending the border crisis with a barrier or border wall that is PROVEN to work is just common sense!
The Fake News Media keeps saying we haven‚Äôt built any NEW WALL. Below is a section just completed on the border. Anti-climbing feature included. Very high, strong and beautiful! Also, many miles already renovated and in service!
"In life, there are certain principles worth fighting for ‚Äì principles that are more important than politics, party, or personal convenience...
The safety and security and sovereignty of the United States is the most important principle of all."
"President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs schedule for Friday, January 11th:
¬∑ Roundtable discussion on border security and safe communities with State, local, and community leaders"
"The American people want border security, not continued obstructionism. If the Democrats truly care about border security, they should immediately fund the border wall." - Dan Bongino
BUILD THE WALL!
‚Ä™President Obama, thank you for your great support ‚Äì I have been saying this all along!‚Ä¨
Our country is doing so well in so many ways ‚Äì great jobs numbers, rebuilding our military, taking care of veterans, strong economy, historic tax cuts, slashed regulations, and great trade deals. But we MUST fix our Southern Border!
The Border Wall would very quickly PAY FOR ITSELF. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion dollars a year ‚Äì vastly more than the $5.7 billion dollars we have requested from Congress.
America First, always.
To every Member of Congress: pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call Congress and tell them to finally ‚Äì after all of these decades ‚Äì SECURE OUR BORDER.
"What‚Äôs more important to the Democrats? Stopping me from fulfilling another one of my promises, or working together to secure the border?
Americans want border security!"
Illegal immigration costs our nation $275 BILLION a year, MILLIONS of jobs, and THOUSANDS of innocent lives. What is it going to take to finally secure our border?
We created more than a quarter-million jobs last month. Employers are showing great confidence in our economy despite all the negativity coming from anti-Trump economic ‚Äúexperts!"
We are now planning a steel barrier rather than concrete. Stronger, less obtrusive, and made in the U.S.A.
Think of this: Democrats want $12 billion in addition to the $54 billion we give in foreign aid, but they won‚Äôt approve $5.6 billion for a wall.
We ended 2018 STRONG - best year for job creation since 2015!
JOBS JOBS JOBS!
We're in a shutdown because Democrats are worried about the 2020 presidential election. They know they can‚Äôt win so they are going all out on the desperately needed wall and border security. PURELY POLITICS!
"Democrats‚Äô immigration policies are reckless and extreme. They want totally open borders, which means drugs and crime will pour into our country. 
We need a STRONG and SECURE Southern Border!"

17 years since September 11th. We will never forget.
Economic growth is on fire! But if we don‚Äôt win in the midterms, Democrats will reverse all of the incredible progress we‚Äôve made.  We can‚Äôt let that happen!
The Left is going crazy because their horrible ideas have been rejected by the American people. This will drive even more Americans to vote Republican in the midterm elections!
America is WINNING again and America is being RESPECTED again.

The Failing New York Times!
The Democrats will build walls in other countries, but over here, they let everybody pour in and don't worry about the crime. Total DISGRACE!
Every day, Democrats are RESISTING the will of the American people and trying to undermine the verdict of our democracy, delivered so strongly in 2016 ‚Äì because their ideas have been REJECTED!
What we have done together has started one of the greatest REVOLUTIONS that has ever taken place in our country.

While we're busy making America great again, Democrats are working overtime to bring America down. They are NO match for my great supporters!
The Democrat Party is held hostage by the RESISTANCE: left-wing haters and angry mobs. They‚Äôre trying to tear down our great country ‚Äî but we‚Äôre not letting it happen!
Who is more likely to be treasonous? Your democratically elected president, or RESISTANCE hypocrites who reject American democracy? Resistance!
I don‚Äôt think anyone has ever done what WE have done in such a short amount of time. A-PLUS!
The FAKE news is the real enemy of the people.
This November you can either vote for the party that says ‚ÄúAmerica was never great,‚Äù or you can vote proudly for AMERICA ‚Äî the greatest country in the world!
We have almost 400 people in our administration that have been waiting over a year to get approved. This has never happened before in the history of our country. TOTAL DISGRACE!
Do we want to continue the amazing progress we‚Äôve made for America, or do we want to surrender that progress to the forces of extremism and obstruction?

Thank you for the kind words Omarosa!
Thank you to the many Americans who are standing up for the TRUTH. When you make your voice heard, you help the #MAGA movement!
The new Democrat socialist agenda would reverse all of the progress we‚Äôve made. VOTE REPUBLICAN if you want to keep lower taxes, low unemployment, fewer regulations, and a booming economy!

America's economic surrender ENDED the day that I took office!
Last week, U.S. Korean War remains were returned to American soil during a beautiful ceremony with Vice President Mike Pence. These fallen heroes will never be forgotten.
Now that we have the best economy in the history of our country, this is the time to straighten out the WORST trade deals ever made. We can do much better!

Tariffs are working far better than anyone ever anticipated. Our market is STRONGER than ever and will go up dramatically when these horrible trade deals are successfully renegotiated. We're going to make our country richer than it has EVER been!
Liberal Democrats are working overtime to obstruct the confirmation of my incredibly qualified Supreme Court nominee. NOT HAPPENING! There is no one in America more qualified for this position than Brett Kavanaugh!

The Democrats‚Äô strategy of all talk, no action won‚Äôt work. Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie know that WINNING means delivering RESULTS! That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing!
The corrupt media has DESTROYED what little credibility they had. AMERICA DESERVES BETTER!

Congratulations to Brian Kemp on your very big win in Georgia last night. Wow, 69-30, those are big numbers. Now go win against the open border, crime loving opponent that the Democrats have given you. She is weak on Vets, the Military and the 2nd Amendment. Win!
Every time I see a weak politician asking to stop Trade talks or the use of Tariffs to counter unfair Tariffs, I wonder, what can they be thinking? Are we just going to continue and let our farmers and country get ripped off? Lost $817 Billion on Trade last year. No weakness!
I'm very concerned that Russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming Election. Based on the fact that no President has been tougher on Russia than me, they will be pushing very hard for the Democrats. They definitely don't want Trump!
African American, Hispanic American and Asian American unemployment has reached the lowest levels ever recorded. The forgotten men and women of our country are NO LONGER FORGOTTEN!
Our country is doing GREAT. Best financial numbers on the Planet. Great to have USA WINNING AGAIN!
A Rocket has not been launched by North Korea in 9 months. Likewise, no Nuclear Tests. Japan is happy, all of Asia is happy. But the Fake News is saying, without ever asking me (always anonymous sources), that I am angry because it is not going fast enough. Wrong, very happy!
The Democrats HATE to see that America's economy is BOOMING under my leadership!
NATO is paying their fair share and nobody has been tougher on Russia than me. Big results will come!
Whether I am at home or abroad, I am ALWAYS fighting for AMERICA and the American people!
There's no stopping our movement now -we still have much work to do... JOIN THE FIGHT against OBSTRUCTIONIST DEMOCRATS! Go to DonaldJTrump.com/get-involved and join us in the greatest fight for our country.
"‚ÄúTrump recognized Russian meddling MANY TIMES‚Äù
The Fake News wants no part of that narrative! Too bad they don‚Äôt want to focus on all of the ECONOMIC and JOBS records being set."
The Democrats want to abolish ICE, which will mean more crime in our country. I want to give ICE a big cheer! Vote Republican in November.
I discussed a range of issues during my meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin, and I think we came to a lot of good conclusions.
Story after story comes out with a negative spin, but we are doing GREAT things. The economy of the United States is stronger than ever before!
I had a great meeting with NATO. They have paid $33 billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future. The media only says I was rude to leaders, never mentions the money!
We want PEACE!
Much to the Democrats' dismay, my policies are working for ALL Americans, especially Latinos!‚Üí https://dpo.st/2uu4NyS
Under my leadership, women and families are doing better than ever in an economy that's THRIVING and a nation that's more SECURE!
Today‚Äôs meeting is only the beginning of a longer process, but we have taken the first step toward a brighter future, and one with a strong dialogue and a lot of thought.
I would rather take a political risk in pursuit of PEACE than to risk peace in pursuit of politics.
A productive dialogue is not only good for the United States and good for Russia, but it is good for the world.
It‚Äôs great to hear that so many Americans are going on vacation for the first time in years, thanks to our BOOMING economy! ENJOY IT!‚Üí https://bit.ly/2NbEbKP
This week we nominated an incredible Supreme Court Justice, made tremendous progress at NATO, and got another strong jobs report. Great things are happening!
The United Kingdom and the United States are bound together by a common historic heritage, language, and heroes.
The enduring relationship between our nations has never been stronger than it is now.
As we celebrate the special relationship between our two countries, on behalf of the American people, I say THANK YOU, Prime Minister Theresa May!üá∫üá∏üá¨üáß
It‚Äôs incredible what we‚Äôve been able to accomplish when you consider the unprecedented opposition we‚Äôve faced from the Democrats all along. Dinesh D'Souza knows this well!
That's my number-one goal: peace all over the world.
For years, presidents have been coming to these meetings and talking about the tremendous expense for the United States. Now, that's changed ‚Äì everyone has agreed to substantially up their commitment.
Great success today at NATO! Billions of additional dollars paid by members since my election. Great spirit!
What good is NATO if Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? Why are there only 5 out of 29 countries that have met their commitment? The U.S. is paying for Europe‚Äôs protection, then loses billions on Trade. Must pay 2% of GDP IMMEDIATELY, not by 2025.
Bilateral Breakfast with NATO Secretary General in Brussels, Belgium...
Thank you to all of my GREAT supporters, really big progress being made. New Poll says Trump, at over 90%, is the most popular Republican in the history of the party. Wow!
There is no one in America more qualified for this position, and no one more deserving.
Judge Kavanaugh has impeccable credentials, unsurpassed qualifications, and a proven commitment to equal justice under the law.

The Democrats can try to resist and obstruct our agenda, but in our MOVEMENT, they‚Äôve met their match!
I‚Äôm going to tell NATO you have to start paying your bills. The U.S. is spending far more on NATO than any other country. This is not fair, nor is it acceptable!
America is WINNING AGAIN because we are finally putting AMERICA FIRST!
We will NOT stand for these vile Democrat smears against our law enforcement. We will always stand proudly with the BRAVE HEROES of ICE and BORDER PATROL!
‚ÄúPresident Trump is resolving longstanding racial injustices against the black community‚Ä¶‚Äù‚Üí https://bit.ly/2KDDpJW

How can the Democrats do well in November? They are weak on the border and weak on crime. The people of our country want SAFETY and SECURITY.
To the great and brave men and women of ICE, do not worry or lose your spirit! You are doing a fantastic job of keeping us safe. The radical left Democrats want you out, but that will never happen!
This was a BIG week, especially with our numerous victories in the Supreme Court. We are creating a lasting legacy for our country!
I will be making my choice for Justice of the United States Supreme Court on July 9th!
In everything we do, we are standing up for our citizens and we are standing up for AMERICA. That is how we will continue to Make America Great Again!
There's no better way to celebrate our WINNING agenda than having a massive #MAGA rally!
I'd like to address the horrific shooting that took place yesterday at Capital Gazette newsroom in Annapolis, Maryland. This attack shocked the conscience of our nation, and filled our hearts with grief...
Today, we broke ground on a plant that will provide JOBS for up to 15,000 Wisconsin Workers! As Foxconn has discovered, there is no better place to build, hire and grow than right here in AMERICA!

FAKE NEWS is alive and well! No matter what I do or say, they will not write or speak the truth. While they continue spreading their lies, we‚Äôll keep spreading the TRUTH!
My message for every young American: LOVE what you are doing and never, ever quit. You are the future of our country, and you are off to a great start!
Maxine Waters and Nancy Pelosi have become the unhinged FACE of the Democratic Party. They should always stay together and lead the Democrats. Together, they will Make America Weak Again!
It's not "build that wall" anymore, it's "continue building that wall!"
My historic meeting with Chairman Kim proved that REAL CHANGE is possible. Challenges may lie ahead, but I believe great things can happen, not just for America, but for the entire world.
Democrats, fix the laws. Don‚Äôt RESIST. We are doing a far better job than Bush and Obama, but we need STRENGTH and SECURITY at the border!
"SOUTH CAROLINA: GET OUT AND VOTE

Join me LIVE in Duluth, MN! Great crowd for a #MAGA rally!
Don‚Äôt worry! The Republicans and your president will fix it!
We want to keep families together, but at the same time, we have to keep our borders strong!
It‚Äôs been months since I offered a deal on a new immigration plan and the Democrats still refuse to negotiate. They‚Äôre trying to score political points instead of solving the problem ‚Äì I am working on a solution!
Democrats are the problem. We want to solve the immigration issue, we want safety and security, and we want to solve family separation.
I want to take a moment to address the current illegal immigration crisis on the southern border...it has been going on for many, many decades...
My supporters are the smartest, strongest, most hardworking and LOYAL people this country has ever seen! As we get stronger, so does America!
With the deals I‚Äôm making, the American people are going to have a very bright, strong, and prosperous future!
Why don‚Äôt the Democrats give us the votes to fix the world‚Äôs worst immigration laws? Where is the outcry for the killings and crime being caused by gangs and thugs coming into our country illegally? CHANGE THE LAWS!
This was a huge week on the world stage. American leadership is back! Watch for more.
This is the BEST economy we‚Äôve ever had. If the Democrats had won, they would‚Äôve raised your taxes and increased regulations ‚Äì the economy would be a disaster!
The Democrats are forcing the break up of families at the border with their horrible and cruel legislative agenda. We need a bill that gives this country tremendous border security! Go for it!
FBI Agent Peter Strzok (who headed the Clinton and Russia investigations) texted his lover Lisa Page ‚Äúwe‚Äôll stop‚Äù Trump from becoming president... The IG Report is a total DISASTER for Comey, his minions, and sadly, the FBI.
We‚Äôve made tremendous progress. No more rocket launches, nuclear testing or research! Everybody can now feel much SAFER!
A year ago the pundits and talking heads were begging for conciliation and peace. Now they are fighting hard to downplay the deal with North Korea!
The world has taken a big step back from potential nuclear catastrophe. Kim Jong-un wants to get something done, I want to get something done ‚Äì I think we‚Äôll get it done!
"Our economy is BOOMING!
‚úîÔ∏èStock Market up almost 40% since Election Day

This is a different Administration, a different President, and a different Secretary of State. We get things done.
Our unprecedented meeting, the first between an American president and a leader of North Korea, proves that real change is indeed possible.
Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on trade anymore. We must put the American worker first...CHANGE IS COMING!
Democrats complain but then they don‚Äôt do anything! Let‚Äôs sit down and negotiate a bill that gives us great border security and safety and that is fair. It‚Äôs very easy!
For years and years, countries have been taking advantage of the United States on trade. We're going to straighten that out.
This week marked my 500th day in office, and I‚Äôm still not tired of winning!
Over the past 16 months, Prime Minister Abe and I have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many...

‚ÄúIt‚Äôs more than ‚Äòcrumbs‚Äô to the people that are working their jobs, balancing their books, and trying to put food on the table for their families.‚Äù Our tax cuts are making a REAL DIFFERENCE!
Today at 3 PM we will put our hands on our hearts for the Pledge of Allegiance and all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem! No NFL escaping to locker rooms!
While the Democrats continue to support criminal illegal immigrants, we're going to defend our borders and fight on crime! The cycle of illegal immigration must END.

I cut taxes so small businesses like Shortway Brewing Co. can grow and prosper. This is what the American dream is all about ‚Äî people who work hard, dream big, and never give up! It‚Äôs incredible to see what a difference our tax cuts are making in people‚Äôs lives.
I want to deliver a message to the long-suffering people of Iran: The people of America stand with you. The future of Iran belongs to you.
Today I announced that the United States will withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal.
We cannot be complacent! We have to FIGHT and WIN in the mid-term elections. I want to know, how are you going to help me ensure a win for the MAGA agenda this November?
Kanye West gets it! And so does Dr. Darrell Scott. African-American unemployment is the LOWEST in history. People are finally starting to realize that big things are happening!
First Lady Melania Trump, your care and compassion for our nation's children inspires us all. Today we pledge to BE BEST!
The Russia WITCH HUNT is rapidly losing credibility. The 13 angry Democrats in charge are starting to find out that there is a court system in place that actually protects people from injustice!
Between the incredible new jobs report and great progress we're making with North Korea, a lot of good things will be happening in the next short period of time. WATCH.
We will never ever surrender. We will never give up our freedom. We will live free and we will die free!
Nobody in the first year of office has done what WE have done. Not me ‚Äì WE!
We know that faith is more powerful than government, and NOTHING is more powerful than God.
There was no collusion and there is no obstruction of justice. There IS important work being done such as negotiations over North Korea, trade with China, NAFTA, and much more. Witch Hunt!
Jim Renacci has my full endorsement! He's worked hard on tax cuts, illegal immigration, the border, and crime. He will be a fantastic Senator for the great state of Ohio! VOTE Renacci on May 8th!
The Fake News media is TOTALLY UNHINGED over the great success of my Administration! We‚Äôre accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while they go ‚Äúbonkers!‚Äù
The Fake News media is working overtime to help the totally out of touch Democrats win in 2018 ‚Äî but they won‚Äôt. We drained the SWAMP before and we're ready to do it again!
I‚Äôm accomplishing even more than I promised, and I'm doing it for YOU. Our great journey together is just beginning! #MAGA
The White House Correspondents‚Äô Dinner is DEAD as we know it. This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for. Put Dinner to rest, or start over!
Every week we continue to accomplish incredible things for our GREAT country. Watch for more on this week‚Äôs REAL news.
The media will never acknowledge all the great things that are happening in our country because they can‚Äôt stand that we're succeeding. They lost, WE won ‚Äì and we will keep WINNING!
‚ÄúNo evidence‚Äù that the Trump Campaign ‚Äúcolluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia.‚Äù Total Witch Hunt! MUST END NOW!
Tomorrow night I'm skipping the Fake News Prom (White House Correspondents' Dinner) to be with American patriots who truly want to MAGA! Tune in at 7pm to watch the rally LIVE on Facebook!
The truth is we have tremendous support. It‚Äôs great to see people like Kanye, Candace Owens, and so many others coming out and really sticking to their guns. We won the election and we‚Äôre doing a much better job than the Democrats did! #MAGA
Even the states that didn't vote for me are enjoying RECORD LOW unemployment! You‚Äôre welcome!
Did you know that at the current rate, it would take 9 YEARS for all of my appointments to get confirmed by Senate? Watch for more from former Press Secretary for Vice President Mike Pence, Marc Lotter.
It is truly fitting that First Lady Melania Trump and I are holding our first official state visit with the leader of France, America's oldest ally. We look forward to hosting President Emmanuel Macron and Mrs. Brigitte Macron at tonight's State Dinner!
The Democrats will obstruct and resist my agenda at all costs ‚Äì even if it means hurting the American people. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm FIGHTING harder than ever to keep the power away from them and where it truly belongs: WITH YOU.
Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn‚Äôt come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal!
Another week of Promises Made, Promises Kept. Watch this week's REAL news!
Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts. Democrats want to end them and raise your taxes substantially. Republicans are working on making them permanent and MORE CUTS!
THANK YOU for the beautiful welcome, Key West, Florida!
Democrats are ‚Äúslow walking‚Äù all of my nominations. Mike Pompeo is outstanding ‚Äì first in his class at West Point, top student at Harvard Law School, a success at whatever he has done. We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP. He will be a great Secretary of State!
I will be meeting with Kim Jong Un in the coming weeks to discuss the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, and we will be doing everything possible to make it a worldwide success.
It was my great honor to host my friend Prime Minister Abe and his delegation at Mar-a-Lago for the past two days. Lots accomplished, thank you!üá∫üá∏üáØüáµ
If you listen to the Swamp in Washington, you would never know that millions of Americans are enjoying many great benefits from our HISTORIC tax cuts!
There is a REVOLUTION going on in California. Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept. The people of the State are not happy!
The U.S. remains committed to strengthening its deep and long-lasting relationship with the Baltic nations. Friends and allies around the world know they can count on us!

Our economy is entering the greatest BOOM in many decades! "155 MILLION working Americans are going to benefit from better business, stronger growth, and lower taxes."
Our country is really starting to rock with businesses pouring back in. There‚Äôs never been a better time to HIRE and INVEST in AMERICA!
Last week, in a video that went absolutely viral, Mark Robinson declared that the silent majority will no longer be silent. Thank you Mark for using your VOICE! The silent majority is BACK!
Remember this tomorrow: This is the LAST TIME you're going to fill out that long, complicated, horrible return!
This week I took bold action to stop the use of chemical weapons, and called on all civilized nations to join us in seeking to end the slaughter and bloodshed in Syria.
James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR. He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted. He lied to Congress under OATH. He is a weak and untruthful slimeball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI. It was my great honor to fire James Comey!
My Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK. We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity, purpose, and pride. AMERICAN SPIRIT is back!
The years of failed American leadership are OVER. When it comes to national security, the tougher the better! We will deliver SAFETY and SECURITY.
Watch former Democrat Harlan Z. Hill explain why he and 7 million Obama voters chose OUR movement. The Democrats think they're going to win big in 2018, but we‚Äôre going to defy the predictions once again!
These headlines tell the TRUTH about what's going on in our country! Working hard and getting BIG RESULTS for the American people! #MAGA
Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War. There is no reason for this‚Ä¶we need all nations to work together. Stop the arms race?
We condemn the heinous attack on innocent Syrians with banned chemical weapons. We cannot allow atrocities like this to happen.
Want to hear the truth? Watch this week's REAL news.
Companies are coming back, jobs are coming back, and millions of American workers are seeing bigger paychecks ‚Äì all thanks to our historic TAX CUTS!
Yet another phony headline by Amazon‚Äôs ‚Äúchief lobbyist‚Äù Fake News Washington Post. Should read, ‚ÄúTrump Defiant as U.S. Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers and Massive I.P. Theft.‚Äù We will not be taken advantage of any longer!
We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U.S. Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion. We cannot let this continue!
Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong. Congress must change these Obama era laws NOW! The Democrats stand in our way ‚Äì they want people to pour into our country unchecked...CRIME! We will be taking strong action today.
How many times have we proven the so-called ‚Äúexperts‚Äù wrong? They think we need their help, but we‚Äôre doing just fine! #DrainTheSwamp
We are preparing for the military to secure our border between Mexico and the United States. WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!
There‚Äôs never been a more exciting time for young Americans ‚Äî lower taxes, more jobs, and more opportunity! With all the work that I‚Äôm doing, they have a lot to look forward to!
I am fighting for ALL Americans, unlike the Democrats, who are trying to divide our country to serve THEIR political needs!
We MUST stop the massive inflow of drugs and people. Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don‚Äôt allow them to do their job. Act now Congress, our country is being stolen!
The White House Easter Egg Roll is under way! Thank you to First Lady Melania Trump who worked so hard on this event and did an INCREDIBLE job!
Watch this week's REAL NEWS!
Our opponents refuse to admit the great success we‚Äôre having on everything from the economy to North Korea, and much more. We are WINNING!
It's time to REBUILD, and we will do it with American WORKERS, American GRIT, and American PRIDE!
We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure, and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio. A tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site, where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined!
Our economy is stronger than it has been in many decades. Business is booming and jobs are coming back like never before!

To prevent the omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all government spending bills.
As a matter of national security, I‚Äôve signed this omnibus budget bill. There are a lot of things I‚Äôm unhappy about in this bill, and I say to Congress, I will never sign another bill like this again.
As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security.  Today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment.‚Üí http://45.wh.gov/Section301
Kim Jong-un finally comes to the negotiating table and the Fake News Media has a meltdown. Talks are a good thing! We are winning!
The Democrats think they‚Äôre invincible, but we‚Äôre going to defy the predictions once again ‚Äî We will KEEP the House majority and we will keep FIGHTING for the American people!
I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also). The Fake News Media is now crazed‚Ä¶Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing. PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH!
‚ÄúSpecial Counsel is told to find crimes, whether crimes exists or not‚Ä¶I think President Trump was RIGHT when he said there never should have been a Special Counsel appointed‚Ä¶‚Äù
"The Democrats‚Äô priority is to protect criminals, not to do what's right for our country. My priority is to serve, protect, and defend the citizens of the United States!
WATCH: http://bit.ly/2ppICIy"
Together, we will END the scourge of drug addiction in America once and for all.
Whether you are a dealer or doctor or trafficker or a manufacturer, if you break the law and illegally peddle these deadly poisons, we WILL find you, we WILL arrest you, and we WILL hold you accountable.
This week I traveled to California to inspect eight different border wall prototypes. We MUST and WILL build the WALL!
We've created almost 3 million JOBS since Election Day and jobless claims are down to a 50-year low. Numbers far greater than anyone imagined!
The Democrats‚Äô strategy is to resist. Mine is to FIGHT for the hard working American people. That‚Äôs why WE are WINNING!
I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back, and we did. We helped Wall Street, we helped Main Street, we helped everybody. Now we‚Äôre going for a PHASE TWO!
We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our country! #AmericaFirst
KEEP AMERICA GREAT!üá∫üá∏
If we don‚Äôt have a wall system, we‚Äôre not going to have a country.
Support from the grassroots is strong and getting stronger! Let‚Äôs keep up the energy and WIN in the very important midterm elections this fall!
If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter. Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones. Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent!
Join me LIVE in Moon Township, Pennsylvania! Great crowd for a #MAGA rally!
We‚Äôre not letting other countries take advantage of us anymore. It‚Äôs all about jobs for our incredible workers and putting AMERICA FIRST!
What the mayor of Oakland did was a DISGRACE, warning illegal immigrants when ICE was about to begin its arrests of known criminals. I need you to stand up against this lawlessness. Show your support for the DOJ‚Äôs lawsuit against ‚Äúsanctuary state‚Äù California‚Üí http://bit.ly/2tAd3Ao
We want every American to know the dignity of work, the pride of a paycheck, and the satisfaction of a job well done!
I am delivering the kind of the results the American people expected when they elected me president. Massive deregulation, historic tax cuts, BOOMING economy, and much more!

China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a $1 billion reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States. Also, we're acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft ‚Äî cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years!
Our economy is coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before ‚Äî and Latino businesses are helping to lead the way. YOU are paving the path.
Our economy is booming and will only get better. This is great news for millions of young Americans who can look forward to new jobs and higher pay!
Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if a new and fair NAFTA agreement is signed. Also, Canada must treat our farmers much better, and Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U.S.
I will always be committed to the American people, and I will always put AMERICA FIRST.
We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as other countries charge us. $800 Billion Trade Deficit ‚Äî have no choice!
We will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need. Working together, we will defeat this #OpioidEpidemic: http://45.wh.gov/apMkN9
No matter what issue or resistance we face, we will continue to prove the critics wrong!
"It was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities. As we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in Parkland, we are determined to turn our grief into action. 
Full meeting: http://45.wh.gov/BipartisanMtg"
Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham ‚Äì an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God‚Äôs grace.
This is a time of great opportunity for our country. We‚Äôre setting records!
‚ÄúHe‚Äôs got a very good point. Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs. Clinton‚Äôs criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be INVESTIGATED. I fully agree with the President on that.‚Äù - Judge Andrew Napolitano
We have to have action. We have to take steps to harden our schools so that they are less vulnerable to attack.
We want an immigration bill that includes border security, ending chain migration, canceling the visa lottery, and a reasonable DACA solution ‚Äî a win-win for AMERICA and a compromise for both parties!
The one thing Democrats are incredible at is obstruction. I'm pushing DACA and the Democrats are nowhere to be found!
The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST. Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done. SO ILLEGAL!
I want people coming into this country based on MERIT. I want people who have skills, who can support themselves financially, who can contribute to our economy, and who will share our values and love our people and our country!
School safety is a top priority for my administration, and we will do whatever it takes to get it done. Real news‚¨áÔ∏è
No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. That's why my highest priority is making our schools and our children safer.
"Today, it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the White House with State and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials.
There is nothing more important than protecting our children. They deserve to be safe, and we will deliver!"
History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes. It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime. Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive. GREAT DETERRENT!
Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren‚Äôt they the subject of the investigation?
When faced with danger, they each put the lives of others before their own. God forever bless these GREAT heroes!
Thank you to Fox & Friends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more. We are now starting to win again!
You wouldn‚Äôt know it by watching the Fake News media, but our economy is BOOMING!
This President‚Äôs Day, I honor all past presidents and reaffirm my commitment to finish the job of those who served before me by making America GREAT again.
Our entire nation, with one heavy heart, is praying for the victims, their families, and the entire Parkland, FL community.
On the night of my election, I pledged to be president for ALL Americans, and I‚Äôve upheld that pledge every day since.
I want to speak directly to America‚Äôs children:  I want you to know that you are never alone and you never will be.  You have people who care about you, who love you, and who will do anything at all to protect you.
"In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country. These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil, and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.
And so always, but especially today, let us hold our loved ones close, let us pray for healing and for peace, and let us come together as one nation to wipe away the tears and strive for a much better tomorrow."
Later this month, I will be meeting with the nation‚Äôs governors and attorney generals, where making our schools and our children safer will be our top priority.  It is not enough to simply take actions that make us feel like we are making a difference.  We must actually make that difference.
Wouldn‚Äôt it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle? This will be our last chance! March 5th.
After many years we have taken care of our Military. Now we have to FIX our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more. Bipartisan, make deal Dems?
Washington will no longer be a roadblock to progress ‚Äî Washington will now be your partner!
So many positive things going on for the U.S.A. and the Fake News Media just doesn‚Äôt want to go there. No wonder the People no longer trust the media... #MAGA
We won't let anything stand in the way of our success as a country. This is the REAL news‚¨áÔ∏è
Every day, we are unifying our GREAT country and delivering for the American people. Watch my campaign team discuss how I‚Äôm putting AMERICA FIRST.
Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election! This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes. Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now!
Our rights are not given to us by man; our rights come from our Creator... Today, we praise God for how truly blessed we are to be American.
America is a nation of BELIEVERS, and together we are strengthened by the power of prayer.

There is no limit to the number of jobs we can create and the amount of prosperity we can unleash. AMERICA FIRST!
To be successful, it is not enough to invest in our economy ‚Äì we must invest in OUR PEOPLE.
TRUE LEADERSHIP: Historic tax cuts, record stock market, unemployment at a 17-year low, money and jobs coming back to America, 40% drop in illegal immigration at our southern border - and so much more!
Just like we expect the leaders of other countries to protect their interests, as President of the United States, I will always protect the interests of OUR country, OUR companies, and OUR workers.

We need more leaders in Congress who will support our #MAGA agenda. Therefore, we‚Äôre supporting Rick Saccone to become the next Member of Congress from the great state of Pennsylvania!
Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown. Now I want a big win for EVERYONE, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security. See you at the negotiating table!

The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it. The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, by Mexico‚Ä¶ The $20 billion dollar Wall is ‚Äúpeanuts‚Äù compared to what Mexico makes from the U.S.

Do you notice the Fake News never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative? ‚Äú90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative‚Äù ‚Äî and much of it contrived! Fox & Friends
Honestly, I don‚Äôt think the Democrats want to make a deal. We are ready, willing and able to make a deal, but they don‚Äôt want to. My standard is very simple ‚Äî AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!
Watch my campaign team discuss how I‚Äôve gotten America‚Äôs economy BOOMING, and so much more, in less than one year as President!
I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level. I want SAFETY and SECURITY for our people. I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs. I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund!
This week showed that President Trump is being totally transparent with the American people. It doesn‚Äôt get more REAL than that!
Yesterday, I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H.R. 2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country. Together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States!
2017 was a year of TREMENDOUS achievement. We began a great American economic revival and we will continue to #MAGA in the new year!
The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval. The safety and security of our country is #1!
The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues. Everybody, including the Dems, knows there was no collusion. Republicans should finally take control!
I‚Äôm appealing to everyone to PUT COUNTRY BEFORE PARTY, to sit down and negotiate and to compromise, and see if we can get something done.
Thanks to all of the Republican and Democratic lawmakers for today‚Äôs very productive meeting on immigration reform. There was strong agreement to negotiate a bill that deals with border security, chain migration, lottery and DACA. http://45.wh.gov/POTUS45

Join us for the first REAL news update of 2018! It's going to be another BIG year!
While the mainstream media continue their Fake News coverage in the new year, we're going to #MAGA with YOU!
Now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media and this PHONY new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. They should try winning an election. Sad!
Wow ‚Äî over 100 companies are making tremendous contributions to their employees and spending money on this country because of the tax bill. Major investments. That means JOBS, and much more! I want to see this list keep growing!

It is also celebrated by millions of Buddhists, Sikhs, and Jains in America, India and around the world.
Our Indian-American neighbors and friends have made incredible contributions to our country ‚Äì and to the world. You have made extraordinary contributions to art, science, medicine, business and education. America is especially thankful for its many Indian-American citizens who serve BRAVELY in our armed forces and as first responders in communities throughout our great land.

"Vice President Pence, Secretary of State Tillerson, members of the Cabinet, General Dunford, Deputy Secretary Shanahan, and Colonel Duggan.  Most especially, thank you to the men and women of Fort Myer and every member of the United States military at home and abroad.
 We send our thoughts and prayers to the families of our brave sailors who were injured and lost after a tragic collision at sea, as well as to those conducting the search and recovery efforts.
 I am here tonight to lay out our path forward in Afghanistan and South Asia.  But before I provide the details of our new strategy, I want to say a few words to the servicemembers here with us tonight, to those watching from their posts, and to all Americans listening at home.
 Since the founding of our republic, our country has produced a special class of heroes whose selflessness, courage, and resolve is unmatched in human history.
 American patriots from every generation have given their last breath on the battlefield for our nation and for our freedom.  Through their lives -- and though their lives were cut short, in their deeds they achieved total immortality.
 By following the heroic example of those who fought to preserve our republic, we can find the inspiration our country needs to unify, to heal, and to remain one nation under God. The men and women of our military operate as one team, with one shared mission, and one shared sense of purpose. 
 They transcend every line of race, ethnicity, creed, and color to serve together -- and sacrifice together -- in absolutely perfect cohesion.  That is because all servicemembers are brothers and sisters.  They're all part of the same family; it's called the American family.  They take the same oath, fight for the same flag, and live according to the same law.  They are bound together by common purpose, mutual trust, and selfless devotion to our nation and to each other.
 The soldier understands what we, as a nation, too often forget that a wound inflicted upon a single member of our community is a wound inflicted upon us all.  When one part of America hurts, we all hurt.  And when one citizen suffers an injustice, we all suffer together.
 Loyalty to our nation demands loyalty to one another.  Love for America requires love for all of its people.  When we open our hearts to patriotism, there is no room for prejudice, no place for bigotry, and no tolerance for hate. 
 The young men and women we send to fight our wars abroad deserve to return to a country that is not at war with itself at home.  We cannot remain a force for peace in the world if we are not at peace with each other.
 As we send our bravest to defeat our enemies overseas -- and we will always win -- let us find the courage to heal our divisions within.  Let us make a simple promise to the men and women we ask to fight in our name that, when they return home from battle, they will find a country that has renewed the sacred bonds of love and loyalty that unite us together as one.
 Thanks to the vigilance and skill of the American military and of our many allies throughout the world, horrors on the scale of September 11th -- and nobody can ever forget that -- have not been repeated on our shores.     
 But we must also acknowledge the reality I am here to talk about tonight:  that nearly 16 years after September 11th attacks, after the extraordinary sacrifice of blood and treasure, the American people are weary of war without victory.  Nowhere is this more evident than with the war in Afghanistan, the longest war in American history -- 17 years. 
 I share the American people‚Äôs frustration.  I also share their frustration over a foreign policy that has spent too much time, energy, money, and most importantly lives, trying to rebuild countries in our own image, instead of pursuing our security interests above all other considerations.
 That is why, shortly after my inauguration, I directed Secretary of Defense Mattis and my national security team to undertake a comprehensive review of all strategic options in Afghanistan and South Asia.
 My original instinct was to pull out -- and, historically, I like following my instincts.  But all my life I've heard that decisions are much different when you sit behind the desk in the Oval Office; in other words, when you're President of the United States.  So I studied Afghanistan in great detail and from every conceivable angle.  After many meetings, over many months, we held our final meeting last Friday at Camp David, with my Cabinet and generals, to complete our strategy.  I arrived at three fundamental conclusions about America‚Äôs core interests in Afghanistan.
 First, our nation must seek an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the tremendous sacrifices that have been made, especially the sacrifices of lives.  The men and women who serve our nation in combat deserve a plan for victory.  They deserve the tools they need, and the trust they have earned, to fight and to win.
 Second, the consequences of a rapid exit are both predictable and unacceptable.  9/11, the worst terrorist attack in our history, was planned and directed from Afghanistan because that country was ruled by a government that gave comfort and shelter to terrorists.  A hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum that terrorists, including ISIS and al Qaeda, would instantly fill, just as happened before September 11th.
 And, as we know, in 2011, America hastily and mistakenly withdrew from Iraq.  As a result, our hard-won gains slipped back into the hands of terrorist enemies.  Our soldiers watched as cities they had fought for, and bled to liberate, and won, were occupied by a terrorist group called ISIS.  The vacuum we created by leaving too soon gave safe haven for ISIS to spread, to grow, recruit, and launch attacks.  We cannot repeat in Afghanistan the mistake our leaders made in Iraq.
 Third and finally, I concluded that the security threats we face in Afghanistan and the broader region are immense.  Today, 20 U.S.-designated foreign terrorist organizations are active in Afghanistan and Pakistan -- the highest concentration in any region anywhere in the world.  
 For its part, Pakistan often gives safe haven to agents of chaos, violence, and terror.  The threat is worse because Pakistan and India are two nuclear-armed states whose tense relations threaten to spiral into conflict.  And that could happen. 
 No one denies that we have inherited a challenging and troubling situation in Afghanistan and South Asia, but we do not have the luxury of going back in time and making different or better decisions.  When I became President, I was given a bad and very complex hand, but I fully knew what I was getting into:  big and intricate problems.  But, one way or another, these problems will be solved -- I'm a problem solver -- and, in the end, we will win.
 We must address the reality of the world as it exists right now -- the threats we face, and the confronting of all of the problems of today, and extremely predictable consequences of a hasty withdrawal.
 We need look no further than last week‚Äôs vile, vicious attack in Barcelona to understand that terror groups will stop at nothing to commit the mass murder of innocent men, women and children.  You saw it for yourself.  Horrible.  
 As I outlined in my speech in Saudi Arabia three months ago, America and our partners are committed to stripping terrorists of their territory, cutting off their funding, and exposing the false allure of their evil ideology.
 Terrorists who slaughter innocent people will find no glory in this life or the next.  They are nothing but thugs, and criminals, and predators, and -- that's right -- losers.  Working alongside our allies, we will break their will, dry up their recruitment, keep them from crossing our borders, and yes, we will defeat them, and we will defeat them handily.
 In Afghanistan and Pakistan, America‚Äôs interests are clear: We must stop the resurgence of safe havens that enable terrorists to threaten America, and we must prevent nuclear weapons and materials from coming into the hands of terrorists and being used against us, or anywhere in the world for that matter.
 But to prosecute this war, we will learn from history.  As a result of our comprehensive review, American strategy in Afghanistan and South Asia will change dramatically in the following ways:
 A core pillar of our new strategy is a shift from a time-based approach to one based on conditions.  I‚Äôve said it many times how counterproductive it is for the United States to announce in advance the dates we intend to begin, or end, military options.  We will not talk about numbers of troops or our plans for further military activities.
 Conditions on the ground -- not arbitrary timetables -- will guide our strategy from now on.  America‚Äôs enemies must never know our plans or believe they can wait us out.  I will not say when we are going to attack, but attack we will.
 Another fundamental pillar of our new strategy is the integration of all instruments of American power -- diplomatic, economic, and military -- toward a successful outcome.
 Someday, after an effective military effort, perhaps it will be possible to have a political settlement that includes elements of the Taliban in Afghanistan, but nobody knows if or when that will ever happen.  America will continue its support for the Afghan government and the Afghan military as they confront the Taliban in the field. 
 Ultimately, it is up to the people of Afghanistan to take ownership of their future, to govern their society, and to achieve an everlasting peace.  We are a partner and a friend, but we will not dictate to the Afghan people how to live, or how to govern their own complex society.  We are not nation-building again.  We are killing terrorists.
 The next pillar of our new strategy is to change the approach and how to deal with Pakistan.  We can no longer be silent about Pakistan‚Äôs safe havens for terrorist organizations, the Taliban, and other groups that pose a threat to the region and beyond.  Pakistan has much to gain from partnering with our effort in Afghanistan.  It has much to lose by continuing to harbor criminals and terrorists.
 In the past, Pakistan has been a valued partner.  Our militaries have worked together against common enemies.  The Pakistani people have suffered greatly from terrorism and extremism.  We recognize those contributions and those sacrifices.  
 But Pakistan has also sheltered the same organizations that try every single day to kill our people.  We have been paying Pakistan billions and billions of dollars at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting.  But that will have to change, and that will change immediately.  No partnership can survive a country‚Äôs harboring of militants and terrorists who target U.S. servicemembers and officials.  It is time for Pakistan to demonstrate its commitment to civilization, order, and to peace. 
 Another critical part of the South Asia strategy for America is to further develop its strategic partnership with India -- the world‚Äôs largest democracy and a key security and economic partner of the United States.  We appreciate India‚Äôs important contributions to stability in Afghanistan, but India makes billions of dollars in trade with the United States, and we want them to help us more with Afghanistan, especially in the area of economic assistance and development.  We are committed to pursuing our shared objectives for peace and security in South Asia and the broader Indo-Pacific region.
 Finally, my administration will ensure that you, the brave defenders of the American people, will have the necessary tools and rules of engagement to make this strategy work, and work effectively and work quickly.
 I have already lifted restrictions the previous administration placed on our warfighters that prevented the Secretary of Defense and our commanders in the field from fully and swiftly waging battle against the enemy.  Micromanagement from Washington, D.C. does not win battles.  They are won in the field drawing upon the judgment and expertise of wartime commanders and frontline soldiers acting in real time, with real authority, and with a clear mission to defeat the enemy.
 That‚Äôs why we will also expand authority for American armed forces to target the terrorist and criminal networks that sow violence and chaos throughout Afghanistan.  These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans arms.  Retribution will be fast and powerful.
 As we lift restrictions and expand authorities in the field, we are already seeing dramatic results in the campaign to defeat ISIS, including the liberation of Mosul in Iraq. 
 Since my inauguration, we have achieved record-breaking success in that regard.  We will also maximize sanctions and other financial and law enforcement actions against these networks to eliminate their ability to export terror.  When America commits its warriors to battle, we must ensure they have every weapon to apply swift, decisive, and overwhelming force.  
 Our troops will fight to win.  We will fight to win.  From now on, victory will have a clear definition:  attacking our enemies, obliterating ISIS, crushing al Qaeda, preventing the Taliban from taking over Afghanistan, and stopping mass terror attacks against America before they emerge. 
 We will ask our NATO allies and global partners to support our new strategy with additional troop and funding increases in line with our own.  We are confident they will.  Since taking office, I have made clear that our allies and partners must contribute much more money to our collective defense, and they have done so.
 In this struggle, the heaviest burden will continue to be borne by the good people of Afghanistan and their courageous armed forces.  As the prime minister of Afghanistan has promised, we are going to participate in economic development to help defray the cost of this war to us.  
 Afghanistan is fighting to defend and secure their country against the same enemies who threaten us.  The stronger the Afghan security forces become, the less we will have to do.  Afghans will secure and build their own nation and define their own future.  We want them to succeed. 
 But we will no longer use American military might to construct democracies in faraway lands, or try to rebuild other countries in our own image.  Those days are now over.  Instead, we will work with allies and partners to protect our shared interests.  We are not asking others to change their way of life, but to pursue common goals that allow our children to live better and safer lives.  This principled realism will guide our decisions moving forward. 
 Military power alone will not bring peace to Afghanistan or stop the terrorist threat arising in that country.  But strategically applied force aims to create the conditions for a political process to achieve a lasting peace.
 America will work with the Afghan government as long as we see determination and progress.  However, our commitment is not unlimited, and our support is not a blank check.  The government of Afghanistan must carry their share of the military, political, and economic burden.  The American people expect to see real reforms, real progress, and real results.  Our patience is not unlimited.  We will keep our eyes wide open.
 In abiding by the oath I took on January 20th, I will remain steadfast in protecting American lives and American interests.  In this effort, we will make common cause with any nation that chooses to stand and fight alongside us against this global threat.  Terrorists take heed:  America will never let up until you are dealt a lasting defeat.
 Under my administration, many billions of dollars more is being spent on our military.  And this includes vast amounts being spent on our nuclear arsenal and missile defense.
 In every generation, we have faced down evil, and we have always prevailed.  We prevailed because we know who we are and what we are fighting for. 
 Not far from where we are gathered tonight, hundreds of thousands of America‚Äôs greatest patriots lay in eternal rest at Arlington National Cemetery.  There is more courage, sacrifice, and love in those hallowed grounds than in any other spot on the face of the Earth.
 Many of those who have fought and died in Afghanistan enlisted in the months after September 11th, 2001.  They volunteered for a simple reason:  They loved America, and they were determined to protect her.
 Now we must secure the cause for which they gave their lives.  We must unite to defend America from its enemies abroad.  We must restore the bonds of loyalty among our citizens at home, and we must achieve an honorable and enduring outcome worthy of the enormous price that so many have paid.  
 Our actions, and in the months to come, all of them will honor the sacrifice of every fallen hero, every family who lost a loved one, and every wounded warrior who shed their blood in defense of our great nation.  With our resolve, we will ensure that your service and that your families will bring about the defeat of our enemies and the arrival of peace.
 We will push onward to victory with power in our hearts, courage in our souls, and everlasting pride in each and every one of you.
 Thank you.  May God bless our military.  And may God bless the United States of America.  Thank you very much.  Thank you.

"Statement from President Donald J. Trump on United States Secret Service 152nd Anniversary
My family and I send our congratulations to the dedicated professionals of the United States Secret Service as it proudly celebrates its 152nd anniversary.
The Secret Service, most renowned for ensuring the personal protection of our Nation‚Äôs top officials and their families, began protecting the President in 1901, following President McKinley‚Äôs assassination.  Every day, the elite Federal law enforcement officials of the Secret Service willingly put their lives on the line to ensure the security of the President, the Vice President, our former Presidents, the heads of visiting foreign governments, and many others. 
As President of the United States, I am honored to recognize the men and women of the Secret Service for their hard work and dedication.  Melania and I are especially thankful for those who selflessly stand by our side to safeguard our family every day.  We are privileged to benefit from the unfailing professionalism and skill of these extraordinary men and women.
Together, we send our very best wishes for success to Director Randolph ‚ÄúTex‚Äù Alles and we pray for the continued safety of the entire United States Secret Service family."
The era of strategic patience with the North Korea regime has failed. That patience is over.

"JOIN US LIVE from the Cabinet Room- 
IMMIGRATION ROUNDTABLE....
We are here today to discuss two crucial votes taking place in Congress tomorrow on vital public safety and national security legislation.
We are joined by the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, Bob Goodlatte.  Bob is one of the most skilled legislators in Congress, and he has worked with law enforcement to write a series of critical immigration bills that will close dangerous loopholes exploited by criminals, gang members, drug dealers, killers, and terrorists. 
Also with us today are Congressmen Peter King, Lou Barletta, and David Young. 
Tomorrow, the House will vote on the No Sanctuary for Criminals Act, which will cut federal grant money to cities that shield dangerous criminal aliens from being turned over to federal law enforcement.
The House will also vote on Kate‚Äôs Law ‚Äì named for Kate Steinle, who was killed by an illegal immigrant who had been deported five times. This law will enhance criminal penalties for those who repeatedly re-enter the country illegally.
Countless innocent Americans ‚Äì including the loved ones of many families in the room with us today ‚Äì have been killed by illegal immigrants with multiple deportations.
I am especially honored to be here with so many courageousfamilies whom I got to know so well during the campaign. 
You lost the people you loved because our government refused to enforce our nation‚Äôs immigration laws. 
For years, the pundits, journalists and politicians in Washington refused to hear your voices.  But, on Election Day 2016, your voices were heard across THE ENTIRE WORLD.
Chairman Goodlatte has produced a package of truly key immigration enforcement bills.  This package includes the Davis-Oliver Act ‚Äì whose passage I called for nearly a year ago at my immigration speech in Phoenix, Arizona. 
The Davis-Oliver Act was named for Detective Michael Davis and Deputy Sheriff Danny Oliver, who were gunned down in the line of duty by an illegal immigrant with a criminal record and two prior deportations. 
Their incredibly brave widows honored us with their presence at my address to Congress.  Today we are privileged to be joined by Melissa Oliver, the daughter of Deputy Sheriff Oliver. Melissa, your father was a HERO and we will never forget him.
We are calling on ALL members of Congress to honor grieving American Families by passing these life-savingmeasures in the House, IN THE SENATE, and sending them to my desk for signature.  It is time to support our police, to protect our families, and to SAVE AMERICAN LIVES.
So with that, I‚Äôd like to ask each of the families and invited guests to say a few words and to share your stories with the American People, beginning with my good friend Jamiel Shaw."
Great meeting with the Republican Senators concerning HealthCare today. They really want to get it right, unlike ObamaCare, which is melting down!

It was a great honor to welcome the leader of the world‚Äôs largest democracy, Narendra Modi, to the White House today. The relationship between India and the United States has never been stronger!

"United States Holocaust Memorial ‚ÄòDays of Remembrance‚Äô Event
--------------------------------------
Friends, Members of Congress, Ambassadors, Veterans and, most especially, to the Survivors here with us today: it is an honor to join you on this solemn occasion. I am deeply moved to stand before those who survived history‚Äôs darkest hour. Your cherished presence transforms this place into a sacred gathering.
Thank you, Tom Bernstein, Alan Holt, Sara Bloomfield, and everyone at the Holocaust Memorial Council and Museum for your vital work and tireless contributions.
We are privileged to be joined by Israel‚Äôs Ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer. The State of Israel is an eternal monument to the undying strength of the Jewish People. A fervent dream that burned in the hearts of the oppressed, is now filled with the breath of life ‚Äì and the Star of David waves atop a great nation arisen from the desert.
To those in the audience who have served America in uniform: our country thanks you. We are proud and grateful to be joined today by Veterans of the Second World War who liberated survivors from the Camps. Your sacrifice helped save freedom for the world. 
Sadly, this year marks the first Day of Remembrance since the passing of Elie Wiesel.
His absence leaves an empty space in our hearts, but his spirit fills this room ‚Äì it is the kind and gentle spirit of an angel who lived through hell, and whose courage still lights the path from darkness.
Though ELL-EE‚Äôs story is well known, it is always worth repeating. He suffered the unthinkable horrors of the Holocaust. His mother and sister perished at Auschwitz. He watched his father slowly dying before his own young eyes in Buchenwald. He lived through an endless nightmare of murder and death ‚Äì and he inscribed on our collective conscience the duty we have to remember that long dark night so as never to repeat it.
The Survivors in this hall, through their testimony, fulfill the righteous duty to never forget ‚Äì and engrave into the world‚Äôs memory the Nazi Genocide of the Jewish People.
You witnessed evil beyond description. Many of you lost your entire family ‚Äì everything and everyone you loved. You saw mothers and children led to mass slaughter. You saw the starvation and the torture. You saw the organized attempt at the extermination of an entire people. You survived the ghettos, the Concentration Camps and the Death Camps. And you persevered to tell your stories. You tell of these living nightmares because, despite your great pain, you believe in ELL-EE‚Äôs famous plea, that ‚ÄúFor the dead and the living, we must bear witness.‚Äù  
That is why we are here today. To remember and to bear witness. To make sure that humanity, never, ever forgets. The Nazis massacred 6 million Jews. Two out of every three Jews in Europe were murdered in the genocide. Millions more innocent people were imprisoned and executed by the Nazis without mercy.
Yet, even today, there are those who want to forget the past ‚Äì worse still, there are even those filled with such hate that they want to erase the Holocaust from history. Those who deny the Holocaust are an accomplice to its evil, and we will never be silent in the face of evil again.
Denying the Holocaust is only one of many forms of dangerous Anti-Semitism that continue around the world. We‚Äôve seen Anti-Semitism on university campuses, in the public square, and in threats against Jewish citizens. Even worse, it‚Äôs been on display in the most sinister manner when terrorists attack Jewish Communities ‚Äì or when aggressors threaten Israel with destruction.
This is my pledge to you: 
We will confront Anti-Semitism. 
We will stamp out prejudice.  
We will condemn hatred.  
We will bear witness. 
And we will act.
As President of the United States, I will always stand with the Jewish people ‚Äì and I will always stand with our great friend and partner, the State of Israel.
So today, we remember the 6 million Jewish men, women and children whose lives and dreams were stolen from this earth. 
We remember the millions of other innocent victims the Nazis so brutally targeted and killed.
We remember the survivors who bore more than we can imagine.
We remember the hatred and evil that sought to extinguish human life, dignity, and freedom.
But we also remember the light that shone through the darkness.
We remember sisters and brothers who gave everything to those they loved ‚Äì survivors like Steven Springfield who in the long death march carried his brother on his back. As he said, ‚ÄúI just couldn‚Äôt give in.‚Äù
We remember the brave souls who banded together to save the lives of their neighbors ‚Äì even at the risk of their own.
And we remember those first hopeful moments of liberation, when at long last the American soldiers arrived in camps and cities throughout occupied Europe ‚Äì waving the same beautiful flags before us today, speaking those three glorious words: ‚Äúyou are free.‚Äù
It is this love of freedom, this embrace of human dignity ‚Äì this call to courage in the face of evil ‚Äì that the Survivors here today have helped to write onto our hearts. The Jewish people have endured oppression, persecution, and those who have sought and planned their destruction. Yet, through the suffering, they have persevered. They have thrived. And they have enlightened the world.
We stand in awe of the unbreakable spirit of the Jewish People.
I want to close with a story ‚Äì enshrined in the Museum ‚Äì that captures the moment of liberation in the final days of the war.
It is the story of Gerda Klein, a young Jewish woman from Poland. Some of you know her. Gerda‚Äôs family was murdered by the Nazis. She spent three years imprisoned in labor camps ‚Äì and the last four months of the war on a terrible death march. At the end, on the eve of her 21st birthday, her hair had lost all of its color, and she weighed a mere 68 pounds. Yet she had the will to live another day.  
 Gerda later recalled the moment she realized that her long-awaited deliverance had arrived. She saw a car coming towards her. Many cars had driven up before. But this one was different. On its hood, in place of that wretched swastika, was a bright, beautiful white star.
 Two American soldiers got out. One walked up to her. The first thing Gerda said was what she had been trained to say: ‚ÄúWe are Jewish, you know.‚Äù
 That American soldier paused. And then he said, ‚Äúso am I.‚Äù
 It was a beautiful moment after so much darkness.
 As Gerda took this solider to see the other prisoners, the American did something she had long forgotten to even expect: he opened the door for her.
 In Gerda‚Äôs words, ‚Äúthat was the moment of restoration of humanity, of humaneness, dignity, and freedom.‚Äù
 But the story does not end there. Because as some of you know, that young American soldier who liberated her, and who showed her such decency, would soon become her husband. A year later, they were married.
 In her words, ‚ÄúHe opened not only the door for me, but the door to my life and my future.‚Äù
 Gerda has since spent her life telling the world of what she witnessed. She, like those Survivors among us today, has dedicated her life to shining a light of hope through the dark of night.
 Your courage strengthens us. Your voices inspire us. And your stories remind us that we must never, ever, shrink away from telling the truth about evil in our time.
 Evil is always seeking to wage war against the innocent, and to destroy all that is good and beautiful about our common humanity.
 But evil can only thrive in darkness.
 And what you have brought us today is so much more powerful than evil. You have brought us hope. Hope that love will conquer hatred, that right will defeat wrong, and that peace will rise from the ashes of war.
 Each Survivor here today is a beacon of light ‚Äì and it only takes one light to illuminate even the darkest space. Just like it takes only one truth to crush a thousand lies, and one hero to change the course of history.
 We know that in the end, good will triumph over evil.  And that as long as we refuse to close our eyes, or to silence our voices, we know that justice will ultimately prevail.
 So today we mourn. We remember. We pray. And we pledge: NEVER AGAIN.
 Thank you. God bless you, and God bless America.

"READOUT OF THE PRESIDENT‚ÄôS CALL WITH CHANCELLOR ANGELA MERKEL OF GERMANY
 President Trump and Chancellor Merkel today held an extensive telephone conversation covering a range of issues, including NATO, the situation in the Middle East and North Africa, relations with Russia, and the Ukraine crisis.  Both leaders affirmed the importance of close German-American cooperation to our countries' security and prosperity and expressed their desire to deepen already close German-American relations in the coming years.  
The President and Chancellor also agreed on the NATO Alliance's fundamental importance to the broader transatlantic relationship and its role in ensuring the peace and stability of our North Atlantic community.  In this vein, the leaders recognized that NATO must be capable of confronting 21st century threats and that our common defense requires appropriate investment in military capabilities to ensure all Allies are contributing their fair share to our collective security.  
The leaders agreed on the need to strengthen already robust cooperation in the fight against terrorism and violent extremism, and to work to stabilize conflict areas in the Middle East and North Africa. The President accepted the Chancellor's invitation to attend the G-20 Summit in Hamburg, Germany, in July, and said he looked forward to receiving the Chancellor in Washington soon."

Dr. Shulkin has exemplified strong leadership in this position and in various other roles throughout his career, including as a chief executive and a doctor in academia and leader in entrepreneurial roles.
 ‚ÄúI have no doubt Dr. Shulkin will be able to lead the turnaround our Department of Veterans Affairs needs. His sole mandate will be to serve our veterans and restore the level of care we owe to our brave men and women in the military,‚Äù said President-elect Donald J. Trump. ‚ÄúSadly our great veterans have not gotten the level of care they deserve, but Dr. Shulkin has the experience and the vision to ensure we will meet the healthcare needs of every veteran. Dr. Shulkin is an incredibly gifted doctor who is using his elite talents for medicine to care for our heroes, and Americans can have faith he will get the job done right.‚Äù
 ‚ÄúIt is my honor to serve as President-elect Trump‚Äôs Secretary of Veterans Affairs,‚Äù said Dr. David Shulkin. ""President-elect Trump's commitment to caring for our veterans is unquestionable, and he is eager to support the best practices for care and provide our Veterans Affairs‚Äô teams with the resources they need to improve health outcomes. We are both eager to begin reforming the areas in our Veterans Affairs system that need critical attention, and do it in a swift, thoughtful and responsible way.‚Äù
 Before serving as Under Secretary for Health, Dr. Shulkin served in numerous chief executive roles including serving as President at Morristown Medical Center, Goryeb Children‚Äôs Hospital, and Atlantic Rehabilitation Institute, and the Atlantic Health System Accountable Care Organization. Dr. Shulkin also previously served as President and CEO of Beth Israel Medical Center in New York City. Dr. Shulkin has held numerous physician leadership roles including the Chief Medical Officer of the University of Pennsylvania Health System, the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Temple University Hospital, and the Medical College of Pennsylvania Hospital. Dr. Shulkin has also held academic positions including the Chairman of Medicine and Vice Dean at Drexel University School of Medicine. As an entrepreneur, Dr. Shulkin founded and served as the Chairman and CEO of DoctorQuality one of the first consumer-oriented sources of information for quality and safety in healthcare.
 Dr. Shulkin is a board-certified internist, a fellow of the American College of Physicians. He received his medical degree from the Medical College of Pennsylvania, his internship at Yale University School of Medicine and residency and Fellowship in General Medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Presbyterian Medical Center. He received advanced training in outcomes research and economics as a Robert Wood Johnson Foundation Clinical Scholar at the University of Pennsylvania."

For those who control the levers of power in Washington and for the global special interests, they partner with these people that don‚Äôt have your good in mind.
The political establishment that is trying to stop us is the same group responsible for our disastrous trade deals, massive illegal immigration and economic and foreign policies that have bled our country dry.
The political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs as they flee to Mexico, China and other countries all around the world.
It‚Äôs a global power structure that is responsible for the economic decisions that have robbed our working class, stripped our country of its wealth and put that money into the pockets of a handful of large corporations and political entities.
The only thing that can stop this corrupt machine is you. The only force strong enough to save our country is us.
The only people brave enough to vote out this corrupt establishment is you, the American people.
I‚Äôm doing this for the people and the movement and we will take back this country for you and we will Make America Great Again."

On November 8th, we will END this RIGGED system once and for all!
"Crooked Hillary‚Äôs State Department colluded with the FBI and the DOJ in a DISGRACEFUL quid pro quo exchange where her staff promised FBI agents more overseas positions if the FBI would alter emails that were classified. This is COLLUSION at its core and Crooked Hillary‚Äôs super PAC, the media, is doing EVERYTHING they can to cover it up.

"Here is my statement.
I‚Äôve never said I‚Äôm a perfect person, nor pretended to be someone that I‚Äôm not.  I‚Äôve said and done things I regret, and the words released today on this more than a decade-old video are one of them.  Anyone who knows me, know these words don‚Äôt reflect who I am.
I said it, it was wrong, and I apologize.
I‚Äôve travelled the country talking about change for America. But my travels have also changed me.  I‚Äôve spent time with grieving mothers who‚Äôve lost their children, laid off workers whose jobs have gone to other countries, and people from all walks of life who just want a better future. I have gotten to know the great people of our country, and I‚Äôve been humbled by the faith they‚Äôve placed in me. I pledge to be a better man tomorrow, and will never, ever let you down.
Let‚Äôs be honest.  We‚Äôre living in the real world.  This is nothing more than a distraction from the important issues we are facing today.  We are losing our jobs, we are less safe than we were 8 years ago and Washington is broken.
Hillary Clinton, and her kind, have run our country into the ground.
I‚Äôve said some foolish things, but there is a big difference between words and actions. Bill Clinton has actually abused women and Hillary has bullied, attacked, shamed and intimidated his victims. We will discuss this more in the coming days.
See you at the debate on Sunday."
Crooked's performance as Secretary of State was even worse than Tim Kaine's performance in the debate! No more "DREAM DEALS" for our enemies. Believe me -- we WILL be TOUGH. #BigLeagueTruth

There's a reason why people question the TRUSTWORTHINESS of Hillary Clinton and that's because they're paying attention! CROOKED Hillary is shady!
This is Crooked Hillary at her finest! Our future Vice President Mike Pence speaks the TRUTH about the shady Clinton Foundation!
Tim Kaine and Hillary Clinton have some things in common! Just like Clinton, Kaine also has a pay-to-play problem! Like I said, CORRUPTION!
I am PROUD to have Mike Pence as my running mate! He balanced his budget and finished his term with $2 billion in the bank. What has Tim Kaine done?!
I stand for ALL AMERICANS! Deplorables, basement dwellers, I stand for ALL of YOU!
We need new leadership and a STRONG American president!
i AGREE! Police officers and other law enforcement officers are the BEST OF US!
ISIS is no weaker than it was a year ago. What strategy?! Hillary Clinton would be more of the same! We need a change! I will #MakeAmericaSafeAgain!
Law enforcement is a force for GOOD! They bring communities together and keep us safe. We must respect and stand by them!

Crooked Hillary has put her own self-interest ahead of everyday Americans for 30 YEARS and she wonders why she isn‚Äôt 50 points ahead -- Unbelievable!

For 30 years -- 30 YEARS -- Hillary Clinton hasn‚Äôt fixed anything. In fact, her only experience has been at failing. As President, believe me, there will be dramatic change. We are going to get things DONE! #AmericaFirst

Today once again proved that the system is absolutely rigged. How Crooked Hillary got away with sharing TOP SECRET emails and LYING about it is just absolutely unbelievable! Crooked Hillary should be prosecuted, not running for President! #CrookedHillary #RiggedSystem
FBI DIRECTOR: "No doubt that un-cleared people had access to the server. There were others who maintained the server....who were private sector folks...."
The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but the FBI Director did indict her today for her incredible lack of judgment and honesty. Watch her LIE over and over again. Unbelievable! #CrookedHillary #RiggedSystem

"When it comes to her unprecedented use of a rogue email system, #CrookedHillary has repeatedly claimed  ‚Äúeverything I did was permitted.‚Äù 
WRONG: https://www.lyingcrookedhillary.com/lie/secret-server-hillary-broke-the-rules-lied-about-it
A report by the State Department‚Äôs own watchdog destroys Clinton‚Äôs lie that she followed the rules. She did not get permission from anyone to exclusively use private email for all of her government work; she failed the requirement to use an authorized and secure system for her email communications; she broke federal records laws by shielding her official records from congressional and public scrutiny; and, she ignored warning after warning that her setup posed a significant cybersecurity risk. 
There is no question that what she did was not allowed. The only question that remains is up to the FBI: was it criminal?"

Mr. Trump stated, ‚ÄúI am deeply honored to have the endorsement of Senator Jeff Sessions, leader of congressional conservatives. He has been called the Senate's indispensable man and the gold standard. He led the fight against the Gang of Eight, against Obama's trade deal, against Obama's judges, and for American sovereignty. He has stood up to special interests as few have. There is no more respected man in Congress and we are closely aligned on many issues, including trade and illegal immigration, and I am proud to consider Jeff Sessions an advisor, friend and ally.‚Äù 
Mr. Trump and Senator Sessions surprised the massive crowd at the frontrunner‚Äôs Alabama rally just days before Super Tuesday Primary contest. 
Senator Sessions added, ‚ÄúI am thrilled today to offer my endorsement of Donald J. Trump for President. This election is our last chance to save U.S. sovereignty and to end the domination of the political establishment over the interests of working Americans. Trump alone has rejected the donor class, defending America‚Äôs jobs and wages from open borders, uncontrolled immigration and the massive Trans-Pacific Partnership that will cede U.S. authority to foreign powers. Trump‚Äôs trade and immigration plans will revitalize our shrinking middle class, keeping jobs and wealth and income inside the United States of America. Trump understands that a nation must always place the interests of its own people first.‚Äù 
Senator Sessions continued, ‚ÄúWe are nearing fast the point of no return. The people are hurting. Their wages are declining. Their schools are overburdened. Their hospitals are stretched past the breaking point. Crime is up, and community confidence is down. Americans of all backgrounds and ethnicities, immigrant and US-born, are crying out for leadership that puts their needs first, that takes care of those living and dreaming here today, leadership that understands that there is no constituency other than the American constituency. Mr. Trump is that leader. 
We are witnessing an incredible movement, arising from the people. 
The events of history have aligned to give the people this fleeting chance to bust up the oligarchy ‚Äì to take back control from the ‚ÄòMasters of the Universe‚Äô return it to the good and decent and patriotic citizens of the United States.‚Äù"
"The police in our country do not get respect. Our law enforcement officers deserve our appreciation for the incredible job they do. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain

Historic video from our rally in Michigan last night. For the first time - after asking them for months - the media has finally showed one of my many crowds! What do you think is next? The media may ask Hillary some tough questions? It is time to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be." Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA!
Good morning America! Just received some great news out of New Hampshire! I thank you for the support. I love being out on the campaign trail & meeting so many of you. I assure you that if I become your next POTUS - I will NOT let you down! We will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!
It's the Democrats' total weakness & incompetence that gave rise to ISIS -- not a tape of Donald Trump that was an admitted Hillary lie!
Do you think that Hillary Clinton will apologize to me for the lie she told about "the video" of me being used by ISIS. There is no video.
Very sad what happened last night at the Miss Universe Pageant. I sold it 6 months ago for a record price. This would never have happened!
"Thank you Phyllis!

As I have been saying - only the beginning. We need to protect our homeland!
I have been saying it from the beginning! The refugee situation is getting worse - as each week passes. ISIS is infiltrating the Syrian refugee program- while we have a President who cannot even say the words- RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM!
ISIS is making $400M per year off of oil. I have been saying for years we need to bomb the oil!

Just won IOWA CNN Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11%, but The Wall Street Journal reported "Cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that I easily won!
Thank you to the great crowd at the #USSYorktown in Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina. Listen to the the response from the crowd to my latest proposal - and let me know if you agree with these PATRIOTS?
Statement on Preventing Muslim Immigration:
I am greatly honored by the results of the CNN poll in Iowa. In the end, I believe the final results will be even better than that! In addition, I am especially grateful for the tremendous support I have received from the Evangelicals. Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016
"A date which will live in infamy." 74 years later we honor their sacrifice. I am departing NYC for Mt. Pleasant, South Carolina for an evening at the #USSYorktown. Never forget #PearlHarbor & our #Veterans. #Heroes
Poor John Kasich doesn't have what it takes.
N.Y.C. has the worst Mayor in the United States. I hate watching what is happening with the dirty streets, the homeless and crime! Disgrace!
Based on these numbers - it is clear the MSM will not be determining the next #POTUS! The silent majority - is no longer silent! Thank you! #Trump2016
Well, Obama refused to say (he just can't say it), that we are at WAR with RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISTS.
Wish Obama would say ISIS, like almost everyone else, rather than ISIL.
"Is that all there is? 
We need a new President - FAST!"
Hope he won't spend too much time ripping apart the 2nd. Amendment!
I will be sharing some of my thoughts on President Obama's Oval Office Address, right here on Facebook.
May the Festival of Lights bring our Jewish friends from around the world, health & happiness! Happy Hanukkah!

President Obama will address the nation tonight. He needs to acknowledge RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM! On Friday night in North Carolina, I was asked what I would say to Obama - at this point:
Hillary just said that she will not use the term "radical Islamic" - but was incapable of saying why. She is afraid of Obama & the e-mails!
"GOP National Presidential Poll Averages.
THANK YOU, America! Pundits are spending their Sunday trying to figure it all out. #Trump2016 is going no where! #InIt2WinIt!"
Wonder if Obama will ever say RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORIST?
Thank you for the support in Davenport, Iowa this afternoon! Something really special is going on & together we will all #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! The silent majority, is SILENT NO MORE!

Good news, disloyal Macy's stock is in a total free fall. Don't shop there for Christmas!
I keep saying it. When the President of the United States of America, Barack Obama -  will not issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM - the problem will NOT BE SOLVED!
Very nice, Robert Davi - thank you! The media will not be determining who our 45th President will be. The American people will decide! #Trump2016

After my meeting with the pastors tomorrow - it's off to Georgia for a big rally - many thousands of great people will be there, a beautiful movement!
The Sarasota, Florida, rally yesterday was amazing. 12,000 people chanting their love for our country. It's going to happen, this is a MOVEMENT!
CNN has to do better reporting if it wants to keep up with the crowd.So totally one-sided and biased against me that it is becoming boring!
Sarasota was an unbelievable success. We expected 5,000, a record, but 12,000 showed up! Great love in the air! Thanks!
We boarded the helicopter for Sarasota, Florida - earlier & will be landing soon! See you there. #Trump2016

Brad Paisley came up to see me. A really nice and talented guy.
Hillary Clinton is weak on illegal immigration, among many other things. She is strong on corruption - corruption is what she's best at!

My family has the honor of being interviewed for a full hour by the legendary Barbara Walters tonight at 10PM on ABC 20/20.
I didn't suggest a database- a reporter did. We must defeat Islamic terrorism & have surveillance, including a watch list, to protect America
Under our President, ISIS is gaining great strength.
The American people will decide on our next President of the United States of America! Not the media - not special interests - not super PACs!
The media must immediately stop calling ISIS leaders "MASTERMINDS." Call them instead thugs and losers. Young people must not go into ISIS!
A great evening in Iowa! We will #BuildTheWall & Mexico will pay for it!
I told you so! UnitedHealthcare issues warning. I will repeal #ObamaCare!
THANK YOU to the 10,500+ in Worcester, Massachusetts last night - and the overwhelming amount of support! We will Make America Great Again!

Remember, I was the one who said attack the oil (ISIS source of wealth) a long time ago. Everyone scoffed, now they're attacking the oil.
Glad to see that Ronda Rousey lost her championship fight last night. Was soundly beaten - not a nice person!
I have been saying this for years. NOBODY will be tougher on ISIS than me! Anderson Cooper Anderson Cooper 360 CNN - you should acknowledge this!
When will President Obama issue the words RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM? He can't say it, and unless he will, the problem will not be solved!
Hillary and Sanders are not doing well, but what is the failed former Mayor of Baltimore doing on that stage? O'Malley is a clown.

President Obama states that ISIS is not gaining strength and they are contained.

I am self-funding my campaign and therefore I will not be controlled by the donors, special interests and lobbyists who have corrupted our politics and politicians for far too long. I have disavowed all Super PAC's, requested the return of all donations made to said PAC's, and I am calling on all Presidential candidates to do the same. The character of our country is only as strong as our leaders--- the only special interest I am beholden to is the American people and together we will Make America Great Again!

I think Joe Biden made correct decision for him & his family. Personally, I would rather run against Hillary because her record is so bad.

Great American heroes who averted an attack in France. THANK YOU! Spencer Stone, Anthony Sadler, & Alex Skarlatos.
"I totally disagree with the FOX statement. I do not think Megyn Kelly is a quality journalist. I think her questioning of me, despite all of the polls saying I won the debate, was very unfair. Hopefully in the future I will be proven wrong and she will be able to elevate her standards to a level of professionalism that a network such as FOX deserves. 
More importantly, I am very pleased to see the latest polls from Public Policy Polling showing me at a strong number one with 35% in New Hampshire, the Monmouth University poll showing me, again at number one, with 30% in South Carolina and the latest national poll from Gravis where I am again the clear front runner with 40%. It was also just announced that I won the prestigious corn kernel poll at the Iowa State Fair by a landslide. 
I will be in Iowa tonight with my speech being broadcast live on CNN and other networks. My sole focus in running for the Presidency is to Make America Great Again!"
Even Barbara Bush agrees with me.
Depression- be careful of China!
Markets are crashing - all caused by poor planning and allowing China and Asia to dictate the agenda. This could get very messy! Vote Trump.

From an amazing day on the border in Laredo.
Arriving to check out the border.
I'm going to the BORDER tomorrow. Will be seeing some really brave people. Look forward to a big day!
Rick Perry in my office last cycle playing nice and begging for my support and money. Hypocrite!
I'm glad President Obama followed my lead and lowered the flags half-staff. It's about time!
"Donald J. Trump Orders Flags to be flown at Half-Staff at all Trump Properties in Honor of the Five Fallen Soldiers
Mr. Trump Takes Action and Shows Commitment to Military and Vets
(New York, NY) July 20th, 2015- Today Donald J. Trump has ordered all flags at Trump properties around the country to be flown at half-staff in honor of the five fallen soldiers who were tragically killed in last week's shooting. Mr. Trump has long been a dedicated supporter of our military and our Veterans and if the President won't act, he will.
Mr. Trump stated, ""This disgraceful omission is unacceptable and yet another example of our incompetent politicians. It is a simple yet meaningful and important gesture that signifies our respect and recognition for these great soldiers who lost their lives. We must do better for all Americans, especially our military. We must Make America Great Again!""
In addition to the lowering of the flags, Mr. Trump has established a hotline (855- VETS- 352) and email address (veterans@donaldtrump.com) for Veterans to share their stories about the need to reform our Veterans Administration.
If he is elected President he will take care of these and all Veteran complaints very quickly and efficiently like a world-class business man can do, but a politician has no clue."
We will soon be at a point with our incompetent politicians where we will be treating illegal immigrants better than our veterans.
John McCain called thousands of people "crazies" when they came to seek help on illegal immigration last week in Phoenix. He owes apology!
"I am not a fan of John McCain because he has done so little for our Veterans and he should know better than anybody what the Veterans need, especially in regards to the VA. He is yet another all talk, no action politician who spends too much time on television and not enough time doing his job and helping the Vets. He is also allowing our military to decrease substantially in size and strength, something which should never be allowed to happen.
Furthermore, he was extremely disrespectful to the thousands upon thousands of people, many of whom happen to be his constituents, that came to listen to me speak about illegal immigration in Phoenix last week by calling them ""crazies"".
These were not ""crazies""---these were great American citizens.
I have great respect for all those who serve in our military including those that weren't captured and are also heroes.
I want to strengthen our military and take care of our Veterans.  I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN especially for those that serve to protect our freedom. I am fighting for our Veterans!"
"Donald J. Trump Response to Huffington Post
 Mr. Trump is number one in the unimportant Huffington Post poll, along with all other recently released polls including Reuters, FOX, USA Today/Suffolk University and The Economist.
 Mr. Trump is in first place in Nevada, where he is also number one, by a wide margin, with Hispanics. He is number one in North Carolina and expects to win Iowa and New Hampshire.
 Mr. Trump singlehandedly raised the issue of illegal immigration and started a national conversation about what has turned out to be one of the most important topics of this election cycle.
 Likewise, Mr. Trump is the leader on issues such as the terrible United States trade deals, strengthening our military, taking care of our great Vets and the repeal and replacement of Obamacare.
 If you read previously written Tweets, Mr. Trump has never been a fan of Arianna Huffington or the money-losing Huffington Post.
 The only clown show in this scenario is the Huffington Post pretending to be a legitimate news source. Mr. Trump is not focused on being covered by a glorified blog. He is focused on Making America Great Again."
Get rid of gun free zones. The four great marines who were just shot never had a chance. They were highly trained but helpless without guns.

The U.S. will invite El Chapo, the Mexican drug lord who just escaped prison, to become a U.S. citizen because our "leaders" can't say no!
Can you envision Jeb Bush or Hillary Clinton negotiating with 'El Chapo', the Mexican drug lord who escaped from prison? Trump, however, on the other hand would kick his ass!
Mexico's biggest drug lord escapes from jail. Unbelievable corruption and USA is paying the price.  I told you so! http://www.cnn.com/2015/07/12/world/mexico-el-chapo-escape/
I want to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain
"Jeb's brother George insisted on a $100,000 fee and $20,000 for a private jet to speak at a charity for severely wounded vets. Not nice!
You mean George W. Bush sends our soldiers into combat, they are severely wounded, and then he wants $120,000 to make a boring speech to them?"

Our country is in a major crisis of incompetent leadership. We cannot continue to go on with these politicians who do nothing but talk.
"Mr. Trump believes that Hillary Clinton has lost all credibility when she blames him for the horrible incident in South Carolina. Why would Mrs. Clinton attack Donald Trump for something that he has nothing to do with?
 Mr. Trump continues to send his prayers and condolences to the people of South Carolina. In light of the tragedy, Mr. Trump also cancelled a sold out campaign event.
 At this time of national sorrow, a responsible leader should be focused on uniting and healing the country.
 Mr. Trump believes that Hillary Clinton does not have any credibility when she blames words for violence. This is the same politician who lied to the world after she failed to take proper steps to secure the U.S. Consulate in Benghazi and falsely blamed the radical Islamic attack on a YouTube video. This is the same person who illegally deleted her emails after getting a subpoena from the U.S. Congress.
 It is totally inappropriate for Mrs. Clinton to exploit this terrible tragedy and use it as an opportunity to attack Donald Trump. She must be nervous about something."
Hillary Clinton reaches new low. #TrumpVlog

"DONALD J. TRUMP WINS MAJOR VICTORY OVER N.Y STATE ATTORNEY GENERAL ERIC SCHNEIDERMAN
 (For Further Information Contact Michael Cohen 212.836.3212 Mcohen@trumporg.com
or Jeff Goldman 212.867.4466 x312  jeffgoldman@bbwg.com)
The New York State Supreme Court has just issued various rulings which destroy the case brought by New York State Attorney General Eric Schneiderman against Donald J. Trump‚Äôs Trump University.  The three most important causes of actions have been thrown out entirely and the $40M damage claim is now down to a very small amount of money, if any.  The minor remaining portions of the case create a very heavy burden for the Attorney General to win, as his case is based on ‚Äúinadmissible, unsigned evidence,‚Äù according to the Court ruling.  Schneiderman also lost his motion for summary judgment because there was no proof of any fraud whatsoever.  Indeed, the Court called out Schneiderman‚Äôs ‚Äúevidentiary deficiencies.‚Äù  
Mr. Trump stated ‚ÄúEric Schneiderman is a total lightweight who is considered by many, including myself, to be the worst Attorney General in the United States.  He spent millions of dollars of taxpayers‚Äô money trying to build his name and reputation on publicity by going after me and now his entire case has been totally decimated. This all for a school that has a 98% approval rating from its students.  The Better Business Bureau has recently given the school an A rating.  In my opinion, he is a corrupt politician.  All you have to do is look at what is taking place with the Moreland Commission, etc.  Because of his frivolous lawsuits, many jobs are leaving New York City and New York State.  As soon as this case is over we will consider re-opening the school to all of our students and hire back the teachers and others, thereby creating lots of jobs for New York.‚Äù
‚ÄúThe publicity-mad Schneiderman is desperately trying to change his weak and ineffective image with the voters prior to election‚Äù continued Mr. Trump. ‚ÄúThe State desperately wanted to settle this case with me‚ÄîI have no interest in settling and most of the case is now won. Almost the entire case has been thrown out and the remainder totally weakened.  The original lawsuit was brought in the names of 10,000 students, almost all of whom signed affidavits praising the school, and is now reduced to less than 1,000 students. While the judge would not allow us to sue, at this time, for malicious prosecution, she stated that we can come back at a later date with this charge‚Äîwhich we will.‚Äù The highest fine for operating without a license in the history of New York has only been a few thousand dollars and we will appeal this part of the decision.
Sadly, certain newspapers did not cover this victory correctly and only spoke to Schneiderman and his people. The real fact is this has been almost a complete and total victory for Donald Trump and the school."
I can't believe that Mitt Romney would run for president again. He had his chance and blew it in the last weeks of the race.
Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf. Worse than Carter.

Something very important, and indeed society changing, may come out of the Ebola epidemic that will be a very good thing: NO SHAKING HANDS!
#TrumpAdvice
I've realized that success requires 100% effort and 100% focus. Nothing less. Get out there and go for it.
Obama can attend a fundraiser every day but can‚Äôt be bothered to get briefed on national security. Commander-in-Chief?!
I wonder if I run for PRESIDENT, will the haters and losers vote for me knowing that I will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN? I say they will!
My friend Derek Jeter is a special athlete & special person-- there is nobody like him.

I can't believe that the judge in the Oscar Pistorious case has found him not guilty of murder. No one has been more guilty since O.J.!
If Obama resigns from office NOW, thereby doing a great service to the country- I will give him free lifetime golf at any one of my courses!
Why are we giving away our entire strategy and tactics we will deploy against ISIS? It puts our troops at a disadvantage.
President Obama has just reached an ALL-TIME low approval rating! Is anybody surprised? The happiest person is former President Jimmy Carter.

"WWII vs. Now! During the 3 1/2 years of World War II that started with the Japanese bombing of Pearl Harbor in December 1941 and ended with the surrender of Germany and Japan in 1945, the U.S. produced 22 aircraft carriers, 8 battleships, 48 cruisers, 349 destroyers, 420 destroyer escorts, 203 submarines, 34 million tons of merchant ships, 100,000 fighter aircraft, 98,000 bombers, 24,000 transport aircraft, 58,000 training aircraft, 93,000 tanks, 257,000 artillery pieces, 105,000 mortars, 3,000,000 machine guns, and 2,500,000 military trucks.
We put 16.1 million men in uniform in the various armed services, invaded Africa, invaded Sicily and Italy, won the battle for the Atlantic, planned and executed D-Day, marched across the Pacific and Europe, developed the atomic bomb and ultimately conquered Japan and Germany.
It's worth noting, that during almost the exact amount of time, the Obama administration couldn't build a functioning web site."

Don't negate your own power. Whatever you've been dealt, know you can deal with it. Fear is the opposite of faith.
The Apprentice is great tonight and stars the legendary beauty Melania Trump who reveals her great skin care collection Melania Caviar Complexe C6 available at Lord and Taylor.
Spent full day with contractors at Trump National Doral - it will be amazing!

Thanks for all the nice comments about the Late Show with David Letterman last night. I enjoyed it and David enjoyed the ratings.
Going on Letterman now - let me know what you think - how did I do?  Here we go!
I'm doing the Late Show with David Letterman tonight -should be interesting!
Many people look at successful people & don't see anything but the end result. They don't see all the work that went into getting there.
‚ÄúLuck does not come around often. So when it does, be sure to take full advantage of it, even if it means working hard." Think Big
Last night‚Äôs  The Apprentice once again showed why the ultimate onus lies with the project manager. The buck stops there.
The Apprentice tonight at 9PM ET on NBC- some amazing things happen!
Wow - they are really killing Jay Leno - let him go out with dignity!
Don't blindly pursue a career that others suggest or insist is right for you. It may be worth taking a pay cut for a job you love.
It won‚Äôt stay a buyer‚Äôs market forever. If you can, take advantage and buy property ASAP. You‚Äôll thank me!
Remember the golden rule of negotiating: He who has the gold makes the rules.
NBC just announced that all 1 hour The Apprentice episodes are being expanded to 2 hours- it‚Äôs amazing what good ratings will do!
It was great having @ArsenioHall back on this week's @ApprenticeNBC!
Don't forget to watch The Apprentice tonight at 9PM ET on NBC - GREAT EPISODE!
Ernie Els and myself at Trump National Doral.
So, what did you think of my decision? What would you have done? #CelebApprentice
I'll always like @OMAROSA because she constantly defends me. #CelebApprentice
.@PiersMorgan is right- he won the show because ‚ÄúI know how to play the game.‚Äù #CelebApprentice
.@IvankaTrump looks like a movie star from the days of glamour and beauty. #CelebApprentice
Don't worry West Coast etc. we are not going to tweet who was fired or give any indication there of until after it airs. #CelebApprentice
Paul Teutul is always good on the show. #CelebApprentice
Even @PiersMorgan is impressed by @THEGaryBusey. #CelebApprentice
.@OMAROSA as a cashier- a big mistake by @BrandenRoderick. #CelebApprentice
.@KellyandMichael are both wonderful people. Their show is terrific. #CelebApprentice
.@DennisRodman must be thinking of North Korea. #CelebApprentice
.@THEGaryBusey is definitely different. #CelebApprentice
.@PiersMorgan and @OMAROSA really hate each other. #CelebApprentice
.@IvankaTrump and @PiersMorgan will be wonderful advisors. #CelebApprentice
I can‚Äôt believe he would choose @OMAROSA as his first choice! She is hard to handle. #CelebApprentice
I always believed @BretMichaels was making a mistake in coming back as a competitor. I disagree with him but respect his decision. #CelebApprentice
.@LisaRinna looks better with her reduced lips. Good move, Lisa. #CelebApprentice
Looks like @OMAROSA is up to the challenge. #CelebApprentice
How does this cast look to you? Pretty amazing. #CelebApprentice

.@IvankaTrump and me at the @todayshow this morning.
There is no comparison between @ApprenticeNBC and Shark Tank in the ratings. The Apprentice beats Shark Tank hands down even after being on television for 12 seasons.
Wow, I was just informed that I'm being inducted into the @WWE Hall of Fame-- a great honor -- 4/6/13 at @MSGnyc-
The Oscar broadcast is really boring - where is the glamour and beauty?
Remember, if you don't promote yourself, then no one else will! Likewise, believe in yourself--or no one else will either.
In my office with Banana Joe, who just won the @WKCDOGS at @MSGnyc.
I went to Wharton, made over $8 billion, employ thousands of people & get insulted by morons who can‚Äôt get enough of me on Twitter!
Melania Trump looks amazing in 2000 Sports Illustrated!
.@KarlRove is far more to blame for Obama's victory than the Tea Party.
Good luck @RoccoMediate and nice hat!
Is Karl Rove incompetent? 400 million dollars down the drain and not 1 victory!

Wow- no longer Saturday delivery from U.S. Postal Service- no money- our poor, poor Country!
Had a great time on The Howard Stern Show this morning‚Äîhe will and should never change!
The Country is being run just like the stadium.
The lights went out in New Orleans...the Country's lights went out also. We are not the same place!
As promised, my Super Bowl pick is the San Francisco 49ers.
Instinct has a lot to do with timing. You have to be patient & wait for your instincts to tell you the best time to make your move.
Donald Trump Jr., Ivanka Trump, Eric Trump, and Melania Trump--- all involved with this season's The Apprentice. #CelebApprentice
Little Mac Miller, I‚Äôm now going to teach you a big boy lesson about lawsuits and finance. You ungrateful dog!
Little @MacMiller sent me an expensive plaque for making his song ‚ÄúDonald Trump‚Äù such a big hit. Mac, you still don‚Äôt have the right to use my name.
I don‚Äôt know why the Yankees keep paying A-Rod- they have a perfect out.

The Blue Monster at Trump National Doral.
Had a great time going over renovations for Trump National Doral this past weekend. It is going to be amazing.
She‚Äôs baaack! @Rosie needs me to salvage her dying career. But it won‚Äôt help-- she‚Äôs got no talent & no persona. Too many tv cancellations!
A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings).
".@hardball_chris says he‚Äôs ‚Äúglad‚Äù we had a hurricane!  With many people dying and thousands hurting, MSNBC should fire him immediately. Has a small audience anyway!
http://youtu.be/32WvkwKVRxc?t=21s"
Thank you to Joe Passov (Travelin‚Äô Joe) of Golf Magazine for the great article‚Ä¶ http://bit.ly/PCgw7n
Amazing, various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements--- but media doesn't care about them. It is a great honor to have the media so focused on my statements when they don't cover others.
We have to make America great again!
This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it-- reasons why to follow.
Our country is now in serious and unprecedented trouble... like never before.
House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare.
The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy.
Well, back to the drawing board!
Me voting--- it really is my hair!
I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight --- win, lose, or draw, I‚Äôll be there!
Watch this behind the scenes video of Ivanka Trump's Fall 2012 collection photo shoot.
Get out tomorrow and vote so that we can all finally say those magic words---
A wonderful place.
How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction.
What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications?
My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency.
Press release. Video response to follow.
I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public.
President Obama missed the deadline!
An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel- http://bit.ly/TOU3Fu  A must read by friends and foes of President Obama. End date is tomorrow at noon.
Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy. My honor.
"Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon.
Photo: Lloyd Bishop/NBC"
I will be on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon tonight. Lots of fun!
Not one Trump building, even those along the Hudson River, lost power --- a testament to quality systems and construction.
People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.
So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you!
People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others, I stayed open.
Direct view of crane from apartment window. Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze.
Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree.
I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President.
The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show‚Äî I know more about people who get ratings than anyone.
Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was ‚Äúprofessionally dead.‚Äù I saved her tiny career‚Äînow she knocks my offer on the TODAY Show!
Sarah Jessica Parker voted ‚Äúunsexiest woman alive‚Äù ‚Äì I agree. She said ‚Äúit‚Äôs beneath me to comment on the potential Obama charitable gift.‚Äù What‚Äôs really beneath her?
One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer & give $1,250,000 to each family of the four murdered in Libya due to his administration's negligence. Great idea!
The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity. @Late_Show
What will be the response on Wednesday? If Obama doesn't take the 5 million dollars for charity.
Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain, Bill Clinton, George H.W. Bush, and George W. Bush have released the requested records. Why not President Obama?
The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming! Thank you!
As stated, here is the press release.
You have all been waiting--- the response has been amazing! Watch my announcement now, press release to follow at 12:15.
Story will be released today at 12 noon EST on Twitter and Facebook.
This is not a media event or about Donald J. Trump--- this is about the United States of America. I will be making the announcement on Facebook and Twitter tomorrow.
When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said "Ok, go get him"?
Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden. The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden.
Mitt Romney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward.
I guess they don‚Äôt have freedom of the press in Scotland.  We created this ad and the ASA would not allow us to publish it.  I don‚Äôt know what is wrong with it, it seems factually accurate to me.
I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned!
"A reader just sent me the following:
 ""I wanted to share with you something rather startling. On page 103 of your book, Time To Get Tough, you write this chilling & prophetic statement about the Libyan issue that dominated Tuesday's debate: 'Even with Qaddafi gone now, unfortunately, the price we will pay for our stupid Libyan policy may end up being far more expensive and dire than the billion dollars we've already blown there...We know that al Qaeda is already in Libya.'
 In light of the murder of our US Ambassador in Libya Chris Stevens and the three other brave Americans that were slain, I was stunned when I re-read that. Sagely, you warned this would happen in your book."""
Robert Pattinson- I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen Stewart- but I'm right. If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider.
I find it very sad that we have a President with zero private sector experience attacking an opponent for being successful.
Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart. She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch. He can do much better!
Stupid George Will gave Mitt Romney no chance 3 months ago. Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy.
Obama better than last time, but again, Mitt Romney wins. Good night.
You talk tough, Mr. President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy.
Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama. No wonder nothing gets done.
Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton.
Obama weak on immigration. All words, no action. He's been Prez 4 years.
Obama is looking rhetorical and weak. Mitt Romney is looking strong and sharp.
A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice!
Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma?
I have never seen a thin person drinking Diet Coke.
All-Star Celebrity Apprentice press conference-
The cast of the upcoming season of The Apprentice on The Today Show this morning......
Pretty even debate- no knockouts. However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger. What do you think?
Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective. Ryan must now come back and combat.
Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment. Follow @realDonaldTrump.
47M on food stamps. Over 23M Americans unemployed. 50% of college grads unemployed. And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird.
If Rihanna is dating Chris Brown again then she has a death wish. A beater is always a beater--just watch!
The Celebrity Apprentice cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30 AM ET during The Today Show with Matt Lauer.
I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night.
I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod.
With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate?
A record 46.68M Americans are now on food stamps http://bit.ly/Uz9Hpi  Four more years?
More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate. A new record. See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)!
"Mr. President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts." -- Mitt Romney
Now another Obama speech from 2002 with him talking about taking the rich's 'stuff' Who is this guy? Where's the media? bit.ly/SzIBuR
Trump Tower is one of the country's top tourist destinations.
Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life. You need to stay positive.
As a big job creator, I was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate.
Congratulations to Mitt Romney. He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight!
My daughter Ivanka Trump is being honored by the Wharton School of Finance with the 2012 Young Leadership Award. Also being honored, Chairman Emeritus of the Estee Lauder Companies, Leonard A. Lauder, and Chairman & CEO of Comcast Corporation, Brian L. Roberts.  I am very proud of Ivanka!
Wednesday's debate is day one of the election. Over 700 million voters will be watching.
Obama loves wasting our money. He just made another guarantee of $197M to a solar company. Cronyism!
Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood. Money we don't have going to people that hate us. Moronic.
Thanks for all the great comments!
Republicans and Mitt Romney must get tough very soon.
Check out this amazing video of the talented kids over at St. Jude's Children's Research Hospital singing Hey Jude! Great job!
Our great course in Los Angeles--- Rancho Palos Verdes- watch the video for a look...
I am very proud of Eric Trump. He did an amazing job raising over 2 million dollars for St. Jude Children's Hospital at this year's Sixth Annual Eric Trump Foundation Golf Invitational.  Watch the video to see more about the event which also featured a performance by Lisa Lampanelli.
Muslim Brotherhood head of Egypt Morsi is already making demands on Obama before the WH visit. Obama's foreign policy is a complete failure.
Thousands of great people showed up from Liberty University yesterday. I love standing ovations!
The Republican Party must spend its money wisely and do incredible television commercials. They must be tough and smart.
Just left Liberty University. Chancellor Jerry Falwell Jr. & his father have done an amazing job...great school & the students were fantastic.
A letter written to one of my many critics!
A letter from an amazing woman.
After being ripped off for years, Obama finally figured out that China is taking advantage of us. He's finally listening to me.
Occupy Wall Street is at it again- go out and get a job. It's actually easier work and far more rewarding.
Why doesn't Obama let our marines who are guarding the embassies in Egypt have live ammunition? They need it fast.
Wake Up America! See article: "Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake"
Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had.
In today's video blog I speak about Clint Eastwood, the DNC, and Drew Peterson.

Playing a round with President Clinton and Arnold Palmer at Trump National Golf Club Westchester.
I am very worried that if President Obama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed. We must take care of our seniors.
The golf course in Scotland is a raging success- it's the talk of Europe! www.trumpgolfscotland.com
Obama is petrified of the birther issue so they go on the offensive to try and make the Republicans feel guilty and stupid. Watch what‚Äôs coming!
I knew Chris Matthews when he was sane and, quite honestly, wonderful. Now he‚Äôs gone off the deep end as an Obama surrogate.
Nice letter from Macy's great & talented boss, Terry L.
Watch the video to see the opening of Trump International Golf Links Scotland- an exciting day on perhaps the world's best golf course.
Here is a letter I received yesterday from someone who has had personal experience with our health care situation.
Dishonest reporters knowingly write lies that I said, ‚Äúchildren should not get vaccinated.‚Äù I believe fully in vaccinations and all of my children have been vaccinated. What I am saying is that vaccinations should be spread out over an extended period of time and not given in one massive dose- and if spread out, you will see the autism rate in children drop precipitously.
I am very surprised that Lance Armstrong gave up. I never thought he was a quitter. He should immediately reconsider or his legacy is ruined.
Watch the video to see the opening of Trump International Golf Links Scotland- an exciting day on perhaps the world's best golf course.
I‚Äôm not only honored to be receiving the 2012 Statesman of the Year award, I‚Äôm also thrilled to report that the event has been sold out with the largest crowd ever. This is going to be a very exciting evening.

"This is what happened at a great Scottish Golf Course, Royal Aberdeen. The members are apoplectic. Wind Turbines are a huge environmental hazard that are often referred to as monstrosities --- which they are. I won‚Äôt let this happen to any of my courses, it‚Äôs a disgrace. Also, wind power is very expensive to build and maintain and very, very inefficient. It is an environmental hazard and everyone knows it.

My new golf course in Aberdeen Scotland continues to be recognized as quite possibly the greatest links course ever built and it hasn‚Äôt even opened yet. Everyone in the golf world is talking about it.
I‚Äôve gotten many letters from people fighting autism thanking me for stating how dangerous 38 vaccines on a baby/toddler under 24 months are. It is totally insane ‚Äì a baby cannot handle such tremendous trauma. Now they come up with this ridiculous study blaming obesity in the mother. The FDA should immediately stop heavy dose vaccinations and you will see a huge decrease in children with autism. What do they have to lose‚Äînothing‚Äîbut plenty to gain if I am correct. There is great dishonesty about autism!

China Part 3: There have been sharp comments about the Fed‚Äôs actions from not only China but Germany, Brazil and a large portion of Asia. Obama‚Äôs misguided monetary policy is ruining this country and our chance for economic recovery is being diminished. Oil prices are going up and our stability is in jeopardy. I say start dealing with China as it should be dealt with, and we‚Äôd be taking a step in the right direction.
China Part 2: When people soon have to start paying $25 for a loaf of bread or $10 for a Hershey‚Äôs candy bar, people are going to say‚Äî‚Äúwhat happened?‚Äù Ultimately it will lead to a major recession or perhaps, even the D word, a Depression. On top of everything else, the Chinese are reprimanding Obama for what he is doing, treating him almost like a juvenile‚Äîeven though they were doing the same thing.
China Part 1: President Obama has fallen into the Chinese trap. Rather than taxing Chinese products due to their manipulation of the Chinese currency in order to make their products cheaper to Americans, Obama is destroying our currency by printing billions of dollars‚Äîin other words, cheapening our dollar. This will lead to many bad things such as higher prices, especially for commodities and in particular, for food.
Watch part 2 of my conversation with Greta Van Susteren to hear more of my views on some of the most important economic issues facing our country including jobs, oil and running for president.

After tremendous demand, I am excited to return to the original premise of The Apprentice. The new show will be a terrific way to provide jobs as well as valuable business lessons. NBC, Mark Burnett and I hope this economic downturn can begin a turnaround, and we‚Äôll do our best with The Apprentice to make that happen. I‚Äôm proud to be putting people back to work, and to positively changing the psychology of America.
